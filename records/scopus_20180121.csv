Design/methodology/approach – The study was designed as a series of VL workshops for young public library visitors. Each workshop collected information about children's existing VL knowledge, introduced them to new visual concepts, and measured their engagement and comprehension of the newly acquired material. The study data were collected via questionnaires and observations. Findings – Most of the children who participated in the study workshops showed a solid baseline knowledge of colors, lines, shapes and textures and were actively engaged in instruction. After the instruction, children generally showed an improved understanding of the newly introduced VL concepts and were able to answer questions related to the new concepts, recognize them in images, and apply them in art projects. Research limitations/implications – The study relied on a relatively small sample of library visitors in an affluent neighborhood. The findings are influenced by variations in the topics and delivery methods of instruction. The study findings might not be generalizable beyond the US context. Practical implications – The study methods and findings would be useful to VL educators who work with children. Social implications – As information continues to proliferate in non-textual contexts, VL is becoming an increasingly important educational goal. The study advances a VL agenda and advocates for introducing VL early in life. Originality/value – The authors are not aware of any other study that tested VL instruction on a group of very young children in a public library. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040221845

Yet past studies indicate that medical students and junior physicians feel uncomfortable with ambiguity. Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) is a pedagogic approach involving discussions of art works and deciphering the different possible meanings entailed in them. However, the contribution of art to the possible enhancement of the tolerance for ambiguity among medical students has not yet been adequately investigated. We aimed to offer a novel perspective on the effect of art, as it is experienced through VTS, on medical students' tolerance of ambiguity and its possible relation to empathy. Methods: Quantitative method utilizing a short survey administered after an interactive VTS session conducted within mandatory medical humanities course for first-year medical students. The intervention consisted of a 90-min session in the form of a combined lecture and interactive discussions about art images. The VTS session and survey were filled by 67 students in two consecutive rounds of first-year students. Results.: 67% of the respondents thought that the intervention contributed to their acceptance of multiple possible meanings, 52% thought their visual observation ability was enhanced and 34% thought that their ability to feel the sufferings of other was being enhanced. Statistically significant moderate-to-high correlations were found between the contribution to ambiguity tolerance and contribution to empathy (0.528-0.744; p ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Art may contribute especially to the development of medical students' tolerance of ambiguity, also related to the enhancement of empathy. The potential contribution of visual art works used in VTS to the enhancement of tolerance for ambiguity and empathy is explained based on relevant literature regarding the embeddedness of ambiguity within art works, coupled with reference to John Dewey's theory of learning. Given the situational nature of the tolerance for ambiguity in this context, VTS provides a path for enhancing ambiguity tolerance that is less conditioned by character traits. Moreover, the modest form of VTS we utilized, not requesting a significant alteration in the pre-clinical curricula, suggests that enhancing the tolerance of ambiguity and empathy among medical students may be particularly feasible. © 2017 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033601373

The first part looks to a hazy remembered past of the legal emblem tradition as presented in Peter Goodrich’s Legal Emblems and the Art of Law to learn visual literacy and also to glimpse the essential elements of modern legality with authority, decision and violence. The second part maps how these images and icons of modern legality are manifest in the Doctor Who fiftieth year anniversary special ‘The Day of the Doctor.’ The third stage looks beyond these first order meanings to understand the chronological chaos of ‘The Day of the Doctor.’ The technicity of the image as a portal through time and space that the narrative revolves around charts the implications for the digital end of time for law. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027700334

It provides detailed accounts of both the reading process as understood within the field of literacy education, and of film theory as it relates to issues such as narration, genre and audience. The book focuses on a small cohort of children to explore how progression in reading film develops throughout a child's time in Key Stage 2; it also examines how the skills and understanding required to read film can support the reading of print, and vice versa, in an 'asset model' approach. Since children's progression in reading film is found to be not necessarily age-related, but rather built on a period of experience and opportunity to read and/or create moving image media, Bulman clearly illustrates the importance of the inclusion of film in the primary curriculum. The book provides an accessible study to a large audience of primary teachers and practitioners, and will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in the fields of education, English and media studies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034829538

This goal aligns with global research on visual arts, specifically visual literacy. Being visually literate means decoding images, understanding the relationship between image and context, and recoding personal experiences into visual artworks. This learning is a core outcome of responding activities in secondary school visual arts. However, students will only develop visual literacy skills if they are engaged in their learning activities. Subsequently, this research sought to explore the cognitive engagement of students in the Year 11 visual arts course. The research utilised a mixed methods approach, which aimed to measure factors affecting student engagement. Quantitative measures of student engagement are rarely subject specific, and the creation of a quantitative visual arts diagnostic instrument gave information about students’ engagement that could inform teacher instruction. Factors affecting students’ engagement were determined through exploratory analysis of the diagnostic assessment instrument, with qualitative data used to explain the students’ quantitative responses. Three key factors of cognitive engagement were determined: intrinsic motivation, metacognition and autonomy. Developing students’ skills in these areas may improve their cognitive engagement in their visual arts education. © 2017, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.

Visual aspects of classroom learning of evolution are yet to be systematically examined by science educators. The present study attends to this issue by exploring the types of evolutionary imagery deployed by secondary students. Our visual design analysis revealed that students resorted to two larger categories of images when visually communicating evolution: spatial metaphors (images that provided a spatio-temporal account of human evolution as a metaphorical “walk” across time and space) and symbolic representations (“icons of evolution” such as personal portraits of Charles Darwin that simply evoked evolutionary theory rather than metaphorically conveying its conceptual contents). It is argued that students need opportunities to collaboratively critique evolutionary imagery and to extend their visual perception of evolution beyond dominant images. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84970002333

In this article, we describe the experience of preschool children who participated in Kindergarten Club, a space that afforded them opportunities to shift roles from being preschoolers to being kindergarteners. Kindergarten Club became a catalyst for engaging in a dialogue about kindergarten, experimenting with print and experiencing literacy learning. Within this context, preschoolers embarked on an investigation that centered around business cards. Business cards ignited interest on the part of preschoolers as they explored their potential for social networking and sharing information. The business card investigation evolved into a curriculum that sparked enquiries into the use of print as mediator for self-representation. Assisted by their teacher and members of the community, preschoolers engaged in collective action to create business cards that would bear imprints of their identity. In the process, young children used their writing abilities, proactively utilizing tools and resources to ensure that their business cards bore authentic representations of themselves. The article conveys the importance of listening on the part of the teacher and trusting children to take the lead in navigating their paths as literacy learners. Documentation in the form of artifacts, images and dialogue reveals how young children naturally incorporate emergent knowledge about literacy and their social worlds into their work as learners.

The study revealed that majority of teacher-participants were not formally trained in the processing of visual materials despite the use of technology-driven instructional materials on almost a daily basis, primarily as motivation activity and secondly, as a convenient replacement for a traditional text. Generally, teachers were observed to treat visuals, in particular films, as a written text where process questions dealt more on literary elements. Reports from survey revealed that teachers explain concept of semiotics and expressed as giving more importance to perspective and mood and less to lighting and social distance. Generally, all teacher-participants agree that creating meaning out of symbols or images open up opportunities for critical comments and intellectual discussions.

Though it is not possible to arrive at a precise rate of visual literacy, there is ample evidence to suggest that those who produced/commissioned art were highly concerned about questions regarding the readability of their materials and often privileged artistic motifs over epigraphic content in the design and implementation of certain mixed-media artifacts. These lines of evidence suggest that images functioned as a prominent vehicle of communication in the ancient world alongside, and sometimes in place of, text-based media. Research on visual literacy not only sheds new light on the ancient media contexts of the biblical world but also offers a more explicit rationale for how and why ancient images should be used in biblical interpretation today. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021786277

Herein, the overarching themes have been expanded to include a 12th theme (macromolecular assemblies), 27 learning goals, and more than 200 corresponding objectives, many of which cut across multiple overarching themes. The learning goals and objectives offered here provide educators with a framework on which to map the use of molecular visualization in their classrooms. In addition, the framework may also be used by biochemistry and molecular biology educators to identify gaps in coverage and drive the creation of new activities to improve visual literacy. This work represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to catalog a comprehensive list of explicit learning goals and objectives in visual literacy. © 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 45(1):69–75, 2017. © 2016 The Authors Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84980332252

Figurative images and the activities making use of them were selected from the history units contained in 27 school textbooks (from the subjects of Conocimiento del Medio, a subject encompassing social and natural sciences, and social sciences) from two specific periods: those in which the educational laws known as the ‘Ley Orgánica General del Sistema Educativo’ (LOGSE, 1991-2006) and the ‘Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa’ (LOMCE, 2013- present) were in force. The teaching materials studied were published by the most widely-used publishers in each of the stages studied in the geographic area of the Autonomous Community of Valencia. The analysis was carried out via a research method combining quantitative (ex post facto) and qualitative (based on conceptual categories) methods applied to four study criteria: the presence and use of figurative images, the quantity and kind of images used for the activities, the level of cognitive complexity of the activities and the relationships of significance between the images and the text contained in the books. The results obtained demonstrate some clear differences between the textbooks of the different periods studied, combined with an excessive proportion of purely descriptive and acritical activities, which do not promote the development of the aforementioned capacities. This paper also shows that certain educational routines and traditions, such as the disciplinary code of school history teaching are still present and reflected in practice, thus having a negative influence on educational proposals and impeding the advancement of educational innovation in the field of history teaching. © 2017, Ministry Education and Science.

Design - Photo voice technique, a process by which the population under consideration is provided with cameras and asked to visually document an aspect of their experience. Setting - Social agency in New South Wales, Australia Subjects - Fifteen 16-25 year old refugees resettled from South Sudan or Afghanistan Methods - Three workshops were conducted. In the first, participants learned how to use the cameras and the protocols for participation. Between the first and second workshops, participants took several photographs of places, sources and types of information that were personally meaningful. In the second workshop, participants were first split into small groups to share and discuss the five images that they selected as their most important information sources and later reconvened as a large group in which participants again shared and discussed their images. In the third and final workshop, the authors shared their findings and analysis with the participants and invited discussion. The authors analyzed both photos and group transcripts from the workshops using Charmaz's constant comparative method.

Furthermore, classroom walls could be considered valuable resources to introduce visual literacy among children and teachers. However, Chilean educational policies tend not to pay much attention to visual culture in the classroom. Hence, the selection of visual images displayed on classroom walls as well as the way they are exhibited should be more carefully thought through. Under the assumption that visual resources are pedagogically significant elements, the present investigation examined the images displayed on the classroom walls of the first year of primary schools in the district of Peñalolén in Santiago, Chile. We present a comparative analysis of visual environments found in different administrative types of schools (municipal, subsidised and fully private schools), using a qualitative method, as well as a quantification of the sample schools. The analysis shows that inequality between types of schools reproduces in images, favouring private schools in aspects such as the degree of planning of the visual environment, student participation in terms of production, the aesthetic quality of the images and its iconographic variety. © 2017 NSEAD/John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023169529

The term “visual literacy” was introduced in the 1960s to describe an active and critical mode of reading images that was perceived as necessary amid a proliferation of new technologies for making and disseminating pictures. Yet the phenomenon of the ubiquitous technologically mediated image was as persistent in Crane’s time as it is today, and Crane’s censure of image-making under industrial capitalism shares similar concerns with contemporary efforts to promote visual literacy. In his early toy books published by George Routledge & Sons between 1865 and 1876, Crane focused primarily on creating beautiful illustrations with the purpose of cultivating an appreciation for beauty in readers to help them resist the effects of industrial capitalism. In his later books, particularly those that Crane wrote and illustrated himself between 1875 and the turn of the century (such as Slateandpencil-Vania, Little Queen Anne and Her Majesty’s Letters, and Pothooks & Perseverance), these lessons in Aesthetic values are joined by instruction in visual literacy. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995814740

The multimodal text represents a complex semiotic canvas on which the various systems of signification (verbal, images, colour, layout, etc.) interact in complex ways to produce a coherent meaning. Such interactions affect translation students' understanding of multimodal texts and as such their training must also be visually-oriented in order to improve their translation efficiency when dealing with these texts. The paper is primarily (though not exclusively) concerned with the print multimodal text, and examines how the various aspects of the visual semiotic elements affect the teaching of its translation into another language. One such aspect is the new challenges that have been imposed by the visual on the field of translation studies. A second aspect is the visual implications for translation trainers and students. A third aspect is the wider multimodal context in which they have been found and involves the necessary multimodal approach to translation training, the development of a relevant awareness of multimodal texts and a number of other issues such as students' creativity and the role of the subject specialist in the translation classroom.

Text–image integration in the textbook is described here as composition schemes in increasing degrees of integration: prose primary (PP), prose subsumed (PS), and fully integrated (FI). These schemes enable experimental research with authentic media without diminishing complexity. Seventh grade subjects used media variants in a within-subjects design (N=158). Comprehension tests revealed higher comprehension for FI over PP media variants in one of three sessions (P=0.0073). FI scores were highest for the other tests but not significantly so (P>0.05). A post-test situational interest measure revealed a significant preference pattern of FI>PS>PP. As textbooks follow a general PP strategy, expansion and confirmation of the results would suggest increasing the degree of text–image integration for middle school science textbooks. © Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966292015

This study relied on the use of focus group interviews and field notes to better understand how a group of middle school students felt about their graphic novel reading experience and the legitimacy of this format in an educational context. The researcher's findings suggest that the students enjoyed their graphic novel reading experience greatly; however, the participants did not consider graphic novel reading to be a valuable educational practice. Looking at this data set through the lens of gender supports the stereotype that boys, more so than girls, enjoy and work better with graphic novels. In the focus group interviews, male participants expressed more passion for graphic novel reading than the female participants did. This finding is supported by research (Huestegge, Heim, Zettelmeyer, & Lange?Kuttner, <link href=jaal501-bib-0010>; Moeller, <link href=jaal501-bib-0016>) that has suggested that boys prefer elements of visual reading. Research by Joaquin (<link href=jaal501-bib-0012>) and Moeller also suggested that social aspects of reading work to make a certain reading legitimate or not. The fact that I left book choice open to all students, regardless of gender, may prove to have been a limitation of this study. Social aspects related to gender may have influenced the results of this work. For example, one of the three focus groups was composed solely of boys; perhaps a female student from that particular class would not have felt comfortable engaging in a literacy activity performed by mostly boys. © 2015 International Literacy Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952342578

In addition, no studies have suggested the genre typology as a tool for the interpretation of journalistic photographs. Based on a literature review and visual material analysis from the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza, this study compiles a typology that sets out four photo-genres: news photography, reportage photography, portrait photography and illustrative photography, with related photo-types. The criteria used to distinguish certain photo-types are based on differences in the visual content of photographs, their context, layout of display, number of images, and their fulfillment of informative, expressive, impressive, esthetic, illustrative or marketing functions. As a result, the study describes each genre and type separately, illustrated by visual samples. The conclusion is that although genres have a tendency to merge and create hybrids, and thus, any attempt at classifying them leads to certain generalizations, the typology can be applied as a tool in visual literacy education to facilitate students’ interpretation of journalistic photographs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976385448

The study also examined existing support for visual literacy programs from parents and educators. Design/methodology/approach: The study explored the knowledge of basic visual literacy elements of young children enrolled in two private schools in the New York City metropolitan area. The authors interviewed 17 children, aged four to six years old, about fine art paintings using a semi-structured interview format. Children’s responses were qualitatively analyzed to determine their initial level of visual literacy and their ability to learn and retain the concepts of visual literacy after receiving basic instruction. The children’s educators and parents completed online questionnaires that were quantitatively analyzed to determine their level of support for visual literacy programs. Findings: The findings show that young children exhibited extensive knowledge of simple visual literacy elements (color, shape, line), and limited understanding of more abstract elements (perspective and salience). Children’s knowledge of visual elements improved after instruction. Parents and educators expressed support for incorporating visual literacy instruction in early childhood education. Research limitations/implications: The study relied on a sample of children and adults drawn from two private schools. The sample’s demographics might have affected study findings. More studies are needed using a larger and more diverse sample. Practical implications: The study suggests that young children are ready to receive instruction on visual literacy elements using art images. Children reacted positively to the images and were engaged in the discussions about them, supporting the use of fine art paintings as an instrument to introduce visual literacy concepts to young children. Survey of children’s parents and teachers indicated strong interest in, and support for such programs. Social implications: With the increase of visual information production and consumption, it is important to introduce visual literacy early in life. The study advances research in methods for developing visual literacy instruction for young children. Originality/value: There are no previously reported studies that have examined pre-kindergarten children’s knowledge of basic visual literacy elements and reactions to visual literacy instruction. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987892106

Multi-literacies such as the skills, knowledge and the ability to interpret varying texts and artefacts and the negotiating of meaning generated by texts develops in the process. Social semiotics explores the potential of art to develop literacy practices in which thinking through sign systems is necessary to read and produce a semiotic system or text. Learning through sign systems enables students to perceive their world in new ways, solve problems, read and write, and create interesting texts. Visual literacy studies prove to be a problem for many students. Undergraduates often find it difficult to read and interpret visual information and produce an art appreciation and analysis assignment on that information. Many education students find it difficult to analyse the art elements and visual symbols. The use of metacognitive reading strategies deepens the experience and improves the visual literacy of B.Ed. students, enabling them to present assignments of a higher quality.

It explores the aesthetic dimensions of regal culture produced outside of the traditionally defined sphere of art and politics by focusing on the variety of royal images and symbols depicted on hanging signs in eighteenth-century London. Despite the overwhelming presence of kings and queens on signboards, few study these as a form of regal visual culture or seriously question the ways in which these everyday objects affected representations of royalty beyond asserting an unproblematic process of declension. Indeed, even in the Restoration and early eighteenth century, monarchical signs were the subject of criticism and debate. This article explains why this became the case, arguing that signs were criticized not because they were trivial commercial objects that cheapened royal charisma, but because they were overloaded with political meaning. They emblematized the failures of representation in the age of print and party politics by depicting the monarchy - the traditional center of representative stability - in ways that troubled interpretation and defied attempts to control the royal image. Nevertheless, regal images and objects circulating in urban spaces comprised a meaningful political-visual language that challenges largely accepted arguments about the aesthetic inadequacy and cultural unimportance of early eighteenth-century monarchy. Signs were part of an urban, graphic public sphere, used as objects of political debate, historical commemoration, and civic instruction.

In particular, visual literacy, which refers to the interpretation of elements other than written text, including images, symbols, shapes, and colors, has come into prominence through new learning approaches that emphasize the importance of using numerous stimuli. All texts convey a meaning and a message, which to comprehend requires textual analysis, the different theories and methods of which vary among various types of texts. As discussed in this article, the semiotic analysis theory provides tools for textual analysis concerning the dimensions of narrative discourse. Purpose: This study aimed to determine how a writing lecture activity based on semiotic analysis theory affects students’ writing skills. To that end, cartoon caricatures were selected as visual texts for analysis. Method: This experimental research based on pre- and post-tests was conducted with a dependent group of 40 7th-grade students in a school within Turkey’s Ministry of Education. Data collection involved having each student develop two texts for caricature analysis: one prior to an experiment based on the traditional approach, and the other after an experiment based on the semiotic method. The differences between scores received for each text by all students were analyzed. Findings: Results revealed that textual analysis based on the semiotic theory was more effective for the writing skills of students than the traditional writing method with respect to three areas of evaluation: understanding the subject, accessing the message, and multidimensional interpretation. Conclusion and Recommendations: The findings suggest that the proposed method of semiotic analysis is an alternative to traditional methods used in Turkish-language courses that can enhance the effectiveness of learning and positively affect students’ creative-writing skills. © 2016 ANI Publishing.

The widespread publishing of aerial and satellite images has raised questions about how non-experts interpret these images, how they are able to interpret orthogonal and oblique images and true-colour and not-true-colour images and how they contend with an absence of text or object descriptions in these documents. Research participants (11-, 15- and 19-year-old students) were asked to solve spatial tasks in images and maps of various types. Differences in the efficiency of task solution regarding various types of source documents were analysed, and the generated scores were evaluated according to the participants’ age and gender. Schoolchildren and students were asked to provide their opinions on the difficulty of reading the various image types and their preference for either maps or images as a source for acquiring information. From our study we conclude that: Age has an impact on the efficiency of image and map interpretation. Younger students, for example, 11-year-olds are better at handling tasks in images, while for 15-year-olds the difference between handling tasks in images and maps is much smaller. Lastly, 19-year-old students can better solve tasks in maps. The efficiency of interpretation varies based on gender and source material. The efficiency of solving tasks in aerial images is comparable. Eleven-year-old girls can handle tasks in maps better than boys of the same age. In the groups comprised of 15- and 19-year-olds, the boys are much more successful. The results of the evaluation of objective efficiency regarding image and map interpretation correspond with the subjective preference for maps or images: 11-year-old students prefer images; 19-year-old students prefer maps. Not-true-colour images are subjectively considered very difficult to interpret, but objective results do not confirm this. Students achieved higher scores for tasks in not-true-colour images than in true-colour images. The purpose of this research is to discover effective teaching methods in geography and to support the integration of aerial and satellite images in education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009689417

While earlier reviews of mobile technology may have led to criticism of these devices as being largely for consumption, many current uses emphasize creativity and productivity, with diverse purposes ranging from blogging and social networking to near full-scale video editing, office productivity and language translation. These affordances are further made possible by the large-scale development of mobile applications (or apps). For the vast majority of mobile device users - now numbering in the billions – many of these learning experiences are informal and just-in-time, sometimes unplanned, unsanctioned by educational discourse and beyond the immediate locus of institutional control. As smart technologies become increasingly an extension of the personal, educators are faced with the question: how can we best facilitate and explicate the learning process and design relevant experiences that leverage the affordances of so many mobile devices? This paper explores how the effective use of apps enable the learning process to be visualized in ways that support meaningful and student-centered learning. The authors discuss recent developments in technology, mobile learning and multiliteracies, drawing on a range of case studies deploying mobile devices and using apps as part of learner-led inquiry processes to enable creativity, collaboration and critical thinking. Emerging from these case studies are real classroom examples, teacher-student reflections, scaffolds and working models that all speak to the importance of using apps to visualize learning and support learners at each stage of the learning process. Exploring the connections between mobile devices, media literacy and visual literacy, the paper also emphasizes the collaborative affordances of many current apps and the importance of multimodal forms of representation through gesture, voice, text, video and audio. Citing the common issues involved in deploying mobile devices in most education institutions, the authors argue the need for schools and education systems to move away from infrastructure-led developments towards more learner-led solutions. © ACPIL.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945296021

The challenge for teachers is to select instructional strategies that integrate visual literacy into the curriculum. Students utilizing visual thinking strategies to interpret and produce visuals will help foster a higher level of learning. Knowledge mapping as an instructional strategy promotes meaningful learning. Digital knowledge mapping offers the potential to link knowledge of complex theories and concepts to text, images, websites, virtual learning environments, and audio and video resources. Graphic organizers are knowledge visualization tools that support meaningful learning. Gowin’s Knowledge Vee diagram facilitates students’ use of their metacognitive processes to newly acquired information in order to make meaningful connections. In 1984, Novak and Gowin presented two constructivist techniques for learning: concept maps and the Knowledge Vee diagram. The Knowledge Vee enables students not only to understand the structure and meaning of knowledge but also in making important learning connections. A content analysis was used to examine the presence of themes within students’ final digital knowledge map justification assignment that provided insights on students’ thought processes, creation, and justification of concept map topics used to provide evidence of higher thinking levels and visual literacy approaches.

This chapter identifies an intersection between the two fields by examining the role of digital reproduction in the study of art history, particularly the ways in which reproductions of art objects and architecture in online digital environments provide an egalitarian space for students and teachers to hold discussion beyond the classroom. First, this chapter provides a brief examination of art history’s pedagogical practices as they relate to visual literacy studies. Then, four activities and assignments are presented which highlight the digitized object as a pedagogical tool. Students demonstrate visual and media literacy in assignments that make use of familiar apps like Instagram to perform traditional art historical methods of evaluating images, such as visual analysis and iconography, on the digitally reproduced image. Instructors guide students through web sites that host digitized objects, meeting their students, for example, in a medieval cathedral and discussing the articulation of the digital space. Through these activities, art history instructors capitalize on students’ technological abilities as digital natives while providing them with perspective on image-based technologies of previous eras. Although the focus is on students in a traditional higher education environment, many of the exercises presented can be modified for a younger learner base or the nontraditional higher education student. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944585514

In de-scribing an instructional sequence of visual-based activities and multi-modal projects, this article illustrates photography's potential to improve disciplinary literacy teaching and learning by facilitating metacognition, academic vocabulary, and risk taking. © 2015 International Literacy Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945444434

Design/methodology/approach – The Toulmin method of argument analysis was tested in two related studies. A quasi-experimental comparison study in six sections of English composition courses was implementedatasmall liberal arts college. A traditional one-shot session was compared to a fipped class, incorporating Toulmin argumentation. A Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) test was administered and research papers analyzed using a rubric. A modifed version of the Toulmin method, using images, was implemented in a two-unit information literacy course at a state university. Pretest and posttest information literacy test scores and research papers were analyzed. Findings – The frst study showed that the experimental group performed better on the rubric scores for research papers when results were adjusted by excluding the one honors section. The survey results from this study showed mixed results for the fipped classroom approach. The second study showed a statistically signifcant improvement in pretest and posttest scores from the information literacy achievement test and the research paper rubric analysis showed that instructional goals were at least partly met. Research limitations/implications – Further research in incorporating instruction in argument into information literacy instruction is indicated. These studies integrated the Toulmin method successfully but represent fairly unique situations and thus more studies are needed to assess the overall impact of using this method in the context of information literacy instruction. Social implications – This study was implemented with two different population groups and shows how instruction can impact different groups differently and can be adapted to increase its effectiveness. Originality/value – The study highlights the value of collaborative assessment and of inclusion of critical thinking goals in information literacy instruction through instruction in argumentation using textual and visual means. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930592160

These aporiae originate in the inseparability of the torture from its being photographed, as the images are documentary evidence of that violence, but also instruments of it. Because the idea of ""transparency"" underestimates the complexities of the visual questions posed by Abu Ghraib and misleadingly implies that they can be satisfactorily and permanently answered, I suggest that the first step for any ethical teaching on Abu Ghraib is to query transparency itself and dispense with its concomitant pedagogical emphasis on cultivating ""visual literacy"" in our students and empowering them to critically decode images. Because our students are already so much more powerful than the subjects of the Abu Ghraib photos, I argue instead for an emphasis on self-reflexivity, visual epistemologies, and the politics of spectatorship. This shift has the potential to illuminate our enmeshment in state visualities and our vexed relationships to the tortured prisoners themselves, rather than forcibly rendering them visible and transparent once again, this time in the name of education. © The Author(s) 2013.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892490765

The article is based on an international research “Contemporary art and visual culture in education” which reveals the problematic aspects of contemporary arts and visual culture in education in general. The research method was the discourse analysis of the participants and researchers, who presented the insights in reflective groups and during the interview with teachers and educators. This paper explores how contemporary cultural context and the spread of visual culture provide preconditions for changes in art education. The aim of the article is to analyse the problems and perspectives of integral arts education in formal and non-formal education: what the educational challenges and opportunities appear in the context of contemporary art and visual culture? How the integral arts could be realized in art education practice in different arts disciplines and areas of education? Contemporary art and visual culture is increasingly multidimensional, the wide range of visual art forms integral with per formative arts, new technologies and media merge the limits between the arts disciplines. That becomes relevant pedagogical problem with the fact that arts education is traditionally allocated to the separate arts subjects such as music, art, theatre, dance, which also can also be divided into separate areas. This subject segregation of the school curriculum and strong subject orientation limits multimodal contemporary arts education. Secondary Education programs provide opportunities for several options of arts education disciplines (photography, cinema art, graphic design, contemporary music technologies), but it needs special resources for the schools and professional teachers. Many schools follow on traditional model of teaching art and still focusing on simple interpretation of modern artworks, different media and technical skills. Contemporary model of teaching integrated arts and visual culture in education is challenging, because it is based on visual literacy and critical thinking skills, it emphasizes inquiry-based education, a critical understanding of contemporary art practices, problem solving and creating new valuable ideas. Knowledge and experiences came from various sources: formal, non-formal, accidental, individual. Great potential for contemporary art education has non-formal art education programs and projects. Successful project-based initiatives in art education have been excellent examples of arts integration.Artists and other creative people involved into a process of education, their collaboration with schools and communities could initiate some interdisciplinary and collaborative practices. Non-formal arts education environment creates more space for creativity, freedom and diversity. Additional arts education programs, museum and gallery education, artistic competitions and international projects allows for the wider development of arts education.

Writers, too, have always dealt with the visual world. From the ancient Greek philosophers, through the art writers of the Renaissance and the aestheticists of the early Enlightenment, to the art historians, film critics and media theorists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, humanity studied visual forms and their meanings. In this article we distinguish the tacit understandings people have of the visual domain from what we call visual literacies. The problem of the concept of ""visual literacy"" relates to the ""pictorial turn"" situation in Western culture. Some analogies can be traced to compulsory primary education in the second half of 19th century which spread literacy over Western and Eastern Europe. Is, then, ""visual literacy"" the appropriate concept? As a notion ""literacy"" metaphorically means the ability to catch any sense from a picture, text etc. Also, the concept ""visual literacy"" is probably an oxymoron? A phenomenological experience of ""visuality"" and ""literacy"" shows that in both cases we are dealing with different intentionalities.

The increase of visual artefacts and the accessibility of production and consumption have implications across a range of disciplines, which blurs the boundaries of knowledge formation. Theoretical constraints locate opportunities for the construction of visual artefacts as objects of knowledge that strengthen the formation of literate activities in education. We are often reminded of the proliferation of images in the world in which we live configured by the constraints of ownership and authorship. Theories of the visual are multidisciplinary and therefore mobilise discourses that are accessed by a value structure that adheres with the field itself. This chapter will outline some theoretical approaches of the imperatives within the field of visuality informed by the arts, more specifically the visual arts, and how these theories devise some of the ways literacy is constructed and manufactured in visual arts education. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the discourses of visual literacy and visual culture to situate the provocation of visuality in art education; and to consider the affordances that a conceptual framework offers to better understand 'literacies' in visual arts education. An exploration of visuality provides opportunities to understand the significance of the arts in situating literacy in relation to the visual as object and practice. Through an investigation of artists' practice, audience intentionality, the artwork as artefact, subject matter as purpose and frameworks that shape and construct pedagogical understandings, this chapter considers literacy practices in visual arts education as immersed in discipline content and ontologically constructed in curriculum formations - where visuality is understood as theory as practice and practice as theory. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

The dominating visual representations circulating internationally about Estonia are photo albums, postcards, films, web pages and other iconic items. Photo albums in particular are constituted by the orthoscopic parameters of painting and the innocent notion of 'picturesque'. In Estonia these albums present hardly anything else than architecture and weirdly empty environment. The reason for this might be a long-term impact of ideology of the past that still tends to constitute an idealist kaleidoscopic overview of the country with no social dimension and its problems as a part of it. The modest level of visual literacy is obviously another reason of the endencies of representation that we observe in this research.

We departed from the idea that to foster processes that encourage constructions of significant meanings it is necessary to abandon vision/audio-centric notions of objecthood and offer a general definition of the perceptual object. The test was realised between the participants after modifying the performance conditions: some could not see the visuals, some could not hear the sound and others could appreciate the performance as a whole. Considering the results, we could infer that only the possibility to 'read' the performance as a whole encouraged construction of significant meanings. It would be possible to upgrade the approach, turning visual literacy into perceptual literacy, to contextualise artistic production that stimulates hybrid sensitive experiences.

A post-structural view focusing on images that five- and six year-olds painted in a class-made book, Voices on the Bus, about racial segregation, the article discusses how children used illustrations to convey their understanding of Rosa Parks' bus arrest in Alabama. A post-structural (Kind, 2010) idea of art as an encounter, not as a fixed representation, shaped how the images were experienced for analysis. Using the notion of synaesthesia (the joining of senses), paintings were analysed for evoked emotions and blended sensations (Berman, 1999; Boston, 2001). Additional analysis focused on sedimented meanings (Rowsell and Pahl, 2007), looking for traces from curricular conversations and local/global D/discourses about segregation, schooling experiences and religious undertones (Gee, 1996). The following analytical questions are discussed: In what ways does this illustration evoke a synaesthetic response? How is this image agentic? What are the sedimented meanings from the images? Insights gained are that children can create synaesthetic images to evoke emotions; educators can find traces of sedimented histories in student-made artefacts; and perhaps social action is embodied and expressed through art. Researchers are encouraged to continue using a hybrid of literacy theories and tools for multi-modal analysis. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878192963

Traditional scholarship has now evolved into eScholarship with emerging technologies providing new methods of innovation and new ways of handling classical research processes. This revised research life cycle not only incorporates the established parts of the research chain, from discovery, gathering, and creating, but now has added phases of citing, sharing, preserving and archiving. There are quantifiable elements that help describe unique elements depending on sector and subject matter and format. Previously defined barriers such as geographical, institutional, digital and domain boundaries that had earlier existed can now be transcended to either accelerate or retard the research lifecycle in amazing and innovative ways. This new paradigm shift of current practices or activities today include the range of literacies that must be demonstrated and include information literacy, visual literacy, financial literacy, and increasingly data literacy. The role of the academic library has become increasingly visible as scholars and scientists seek support in managing their research lifecycle components. Librarians are now managers and curators of the scholarly research lifecycle by protecting, harvesting, and promoting reuse of content for new and unprecedented purposes. In a similar fashion, Grey Literature has previously followed the lifespan of more traditional output. Now new technologies exist to extract value metrics that compare favorably with other information products. This paper will explore how Grey Literature matures through different pathways or life cycles as the new grey becomes less grey with metrics of increasing value to support and describe it. Also, the world of publishing has become increasingly accessible to a new population of scholars to release new information and ideas, contribute to emerging fields and frontiers without the barriers or requirements of following a specific trajectory of traditional publication processes. Examples will be shared about how the research life cycle has evolved with new tools to support Grey Literature from the life cycle management (LCM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) models to determine impacts and drive future directions concerning options for actions like open access, intellectual property and other forms of rights management.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924135181

In order to understand the differences between Western images and their Chinese translations, I analyze the nature of science illustrations, the problem of visual literacy and the goals of the translators involved. I contend that illustrators' personal understanding of science and artistic training played a significant role in adapting Western images to Chinese visual conventions and thus potentially aiding Chinese readers' access to Western science.

The essay focuses on two major technological changes in visual media, and on the cultural transformations that have accompanied those changes. The first technological change is the development of increasingly powerful techniques for the digital manipulation of photographs and the creation of computer-generated photorealistic images. Reviewing this development, which has made the task of detecting visual fraud more challenging, the essay assesses the likelihood that it may also have brought about an enhancement in societal levels of visual ""literacy."" Such an enhancement may also be a by-product of the second technological change discussed in this essay, namely, the increasing availability of digital networks for the dissemination of images and for public commentary about those images.

They consider how the Andean peoples received, maintained, and subverted the conventions of Spanish literacy, often combining them with their own traditions. Indigenous Andean communities neither used narrative pictorial representation nor had alphabetic or hieroglyphic literacy before the arrival of the Spaniards. To absorb the conventions of Spanish literacy, they had to engage with European symbolic systems. Doing so altered their worldviews and everyday lives, making alphabetic and visual literacy prime tools of colonial domination. Rappaport and Cummins advocate a broad understanding of literacy, including not only reading and writing, but also interpretations of the spoken word, paintings, wax seals, gestures, and urban design. By analyzing secular and religious notarial manuals and dictionaries, urban architecture, religious images, catechisms and sermons, and the vast corpus of administrative documents produced by the colonial authorities and indigenous scribes, they expand Ángel Rama's concept of the lettered city to encompass many of those who previously would have been considered the least literate. © 2012 Duke University Press.

Yet, in most early childhood education settings in Taiwan, the emphasis of literacy education is still on the reading and writing of words. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating how Taiwanese young children observe and interpret images in wordless picture books, and compared the findings to studies done in the West. Eight 6-year-old children read three wordless picture books-Wolf, Rainstorm and The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher-with the investigator individually. They read the pictures and told the stories in their own words, followed by interviews which asked about their interpretation of the pictorial elements in the books. The children also drew pictures of the things that impressed them the most from the books, and this activity was followed by interviews with the researcher about the drawings. The findings showed that young children's reading experiences played an important role in how they read the peritextual features of picture books. Young children observed more than ten different kinds of visual elements in the wordless books. Both the stories they told and their drawings showed how they perceived the visual elements and pictorial compositions in the books.

Often, there is no clear delineation between these panels, or any indication of the optimal viewing order. To improve visual literacy we propose using Subtle Gaze Direction (SGD) to direct the viewers gaze across an image in a manner which reveals the story. SGD uses small image space modulations in the luminance channel to guide a viewer's gaze about an image without disrupting their normal visual experience. Using a simple ordering task we compared performance using no modulation and using subtle modulation with the correct order of narrative episodes as intended by the artist. Results from experiments show improved performance when SGD is employed. This experiment establishes the potential of the method as an aid to visual navigation in images where the viewing order is unclear. © 2012 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865563552

Contributing to their clarity of meaning were woodcuts, metal prints and even ornaments, decorations that accompanied printed images. While woodcuts functioned in some cases very like manuscript miniatures, and their purposes were as various, they also expanded visual vocabulary, introducing and labelling texts for a mass-market audience. Further, printing allows an emphasis on visual continuity, which can occur within one book or across collections of books, creating networks of meaning for fledgling readers. As I argue elsewhere, with print the development of visual literacy is connected with rising verbal literacy, while organisation of content is most particularly seen with the introduction of the title page. This survey considers briefly some changes that occurred in illustration from manuscript to print, sources for English woodcuts (mainly French), and the ways in which images were used to introduce and sometimes to link portions of texts or texts together in Sammelbände. While every manuscript miniature is to some extent unique (even when copied from exemplars, sketches or model books), woodcuts were mechanically produced and were not usually in colour unless they had been painted by hand.

Initial versions of the images were discussed and assessed in group discussions, and then modified and eventually evaluated quantitatively in individual interviews with 40 participants who each had a maximum of 10 years of schooling. The familiarity of the human body, its facial expressions, postures and actions contextualised the information and contributed to the participants' understanding. Visuals that were simple, had a clear central focus and reflected familiar body experiences (e.g. vomiting) were highly successful. The introduction of abstract elements (e.g. fever) and metaphorical images (e.g. nightmares) presented problems for interpretation, particularly to those with the lowest educational levels. We recommend that such visual images should be designed in collaboration with the target population and a graphic artist, taking cognisance of the audience's literacy skills and culture, and should employ a multistage iterative process of modification and evaluation.

Assuming that the visual literacy is increasingly present in our daily life we should not forget that oral, written and by signs communications occurred with the aim of developing a language to reach a certain type of communication. Therefore, it's necessary to think about the resources that can improve information and communication in educational settings. Kerry Freedman notes that the things the students learn and how they learn, breaks the traditional boundaries in the postmodern world. Actually students can get more details of the images than of the texts, because of this, the art's education and also the education in design, among others, has a growing responsibility. While the boundaries between education, culture and entertainment has increased over the time, students learn more and more from the visual forms. In this context we must study the challenges and the limits of form, the object and the school subjects. The new technologies of information and communication's democratic potential have far-reaching political, economic, cultural, conceptual, cognitive and epistemological that are unimaginable. we consider the design as an agent to bring innovation and difference, transforming and facilitating the subject's interaction with objects, through studies on methods and tools needed to deal with the process of developing projects for the visual learning objects. We will present in this paper an example part of a project of Design in Education, called Multi-Tracks which is a game to help the acquisition of a second language by deaf children. This game was developed by the influence of methods and techniques of Design. The whole project of the Game Multi-Tracks went through a long investigation about the visual language to be used in the components of the game, scenario, cards, etc. Moreover, to illustrate this paper about the acting of Design in situations of teaching and learning, we will present the process of illustrations of Brazilian Signal Language from the project of the Game Multi-Tracks, which resulted in the development of a new graphical language to represent this language. © Common Ground, Cristina Portugal, Rita Couto, Flávia Nizia Ribeiro, All Rights Reserved.",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859548723

The paper adopts the enthusiasm for the cinema metaphor and explores the implications for industrial marketing and business networks, with particular reference to the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper outlines the Cartesian picture theory of the early Wittgenstein, the comparable ""pictures agenda"" within the IMP, then the post-Cartesian ""language gaming"" approach adopted by the later Wittgenstein, and associates it with an agenda to introduce a more ""cinematographic"" approach, introducing issues within the ""linguistic turn"" to the study of business networks. Findings: The transformation of the contemporary ""post-Cartesian"" culture from ""written"" to ""visual"" was not fully appreciated until the invention and mass appeal of cinema and the concomitants of a visual culture became more apparent. In the notion of the ""spectacle"", Debord was amongst the first to show that the postmodern visual culture was one where social relations are dominated by commodified images. The images that prevail, from this critical viewpoint, are ""social opiates"" masquerading as progress that control actors through addictive consumption and acquisition by spectator consumers. In this context, business to business relationships are about how these image-based addictions are maintained within business cultures. Research limitations/implications: The adoption of a cinematographic metaphor would appear to be a pertinent development for understanding of business network relationships. Originality/value: The advantage of a cinematographic metaphor over other, less visual, metaphors is that cinema is more visually sophisticated and entirely embedded in cultures dominated by commodified images. It is appropriate, therefore, that visual literacy, realities as increasingly ""image-dominated"" and ""virtual"" business networks are better understood through the lens of a cinematographic metaphor. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956335374

What is lacking, however, is substantial reference to the planned use of language along with image creation through photography for the language development of English Language Learners (ELLs) in the early childhood classroom. Teacher training, too, devotes insufficient attention to either visual literacy or visual communication. This article provides a discussion of the role of the visual in English language development as a basis for a sample photography project that can be incorporated into a course for pre-service teachers in methods of teaching ELLs. Pre-service teachers thus experience the project first-hand in terms of image creation and the planning of appropriate content, language, and visual literacy objectives.

The book draws from a variety of disciplines, including political science, behavioral biology, cognitive neuroscience, and media studies in order to investigate the visual framing of elections in an interdisciplinary fashion. Moreover, the book presents findings that are counterintuitive and which challenge widely held assumptions; yet are supported by systematic data. For example, Republicans receive consistently more favorable visual treatment than Democrats, countering the conventional wisdom of a ""liberal media bias""; and image bites are more prevalent, and in some elections more potent, in shaping voter opinions of candidates than sound bites.

Visuality, or the capacity to see and be seen, does not necessarily have a critical dimension. Most of the time people do not question the validity of the information offered to them through text and images by media. Critical visuality, however, has to do with purposeful and directed viewing. It means having the ability to see and analyze visual experiences purposefully by deconstructing elements of images and reconstructing them through critical viewing and interpreting messages in a broad social, environmental, and cultural context. Critical visuality therefore is essential to the process of critical visual viewing. Our ability to interpret any visual experience is cumulative depending on previous similar and different experiences and specific understanding of those experiences. It is also determined by the effects of various circumstances and the social and cultural meanings of elements. Each element in a received visual experience needs to be followed with an interpretation of the whole concept, as well as the relationship of the elements to each other in a broader context. This understanding and interpretation of the elements also has to be viewed with regard to the specific historical, sociological, cultural, political and environmental aspects of their being, in the process of making sense of the whole experience. The nature and level of received information, knowledge and experience that support the interpretation of a visual experience all play a role in the process of critical visual literacy. Writing as the other part of literacy, is a process of construction. It includes generating visuals in the form of texts and images, which implies exercising the power of the imagination and creativity. © Common Ground, Anahit Falihi, Linda Wason-Ellam.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950183429

As the Asian culture is said to be collective when compared with the Western culture, it is expected that social relations, both personal and celebrity-mediated, play an important role in the establishment of consumption values. Design-methodology-approach A survey of 190 high school students’ aged 13 to 18 was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Constructs were measured using established scales. Findings The paper finds imitation of media celebrities and perceived peer influence were positive predictors of materialistic consumption values while marketing communication factors were not significant predictors. Research limitations-implications The data in the paper came from a convenience sample of one high school and may not be representative of adolescents in Singapore. Practical implications The paper found that in fact advertising regulation may not impact adolescent levels of materialism to the degree previously assumed. Visual literacy courses may be a better strategy of reducing the level of materialism through discouraging the desire to imitate media celebrities. In turn, this training and heightened awareness could potentially help to diminish some of the negative peer influences in relation to materialism. Media educators should help young consumers to reflect on how their purchase decisions can be influenced by their social relations, including both personal interaction and celebrity-media communications, while simultaneously providing them with the tools to critically assess the images they view.

One method of enhancing inspection skills is teaching ""visual literacy,"" the ability to reason physiology and pathophysiology from careful and unbiased observation. OBJECTIVE: To improve students' visual acumen through structured observation of artworks, understanding of fine arts concepts and applying these skills to patient care. DESIGN: Prospective, partially randomized pre- vs. post-course evaluation using mixed-methods data analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four pre-clinical student participants were compared to 34 classmates at a similar stage of training. INTERVENTION: Training the Eye: Improving the Art of Physical Diagnosis consists of eight paired sessions of art observation exercises with didactics that integrate fine arts concepts with physical diagnosis topics and an elective life drawing session. MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of accurate observations on a 1-h visual skills examination was used to evaluate pre- vs. post-course descriptions of patient photographs and art imagery. Content analysis was used to identify thematic categories. All assessments were blinded to study group and pre- vs. post-course evaluation. RESULTS: Following the course, class participants increased their total mean number of observations compared to controls (5.41±0.63 vs. 0.36±0.53, p<0.0001) and had increased sophistication in their descriptions of artistic and clinical imagery. A 'dose-response' was found for those who attended eight or more sessions, compared to participants who attended seven or fewer sessions (6.31+0.81 and 2.76+1.2, respectively, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary course improved participants' capacity to make accurate observations of art and physical findings. © 2008 Society of General Internal Medicine.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949101925

This paper attempts to show the potential importance of visual culture within a field that we may call cultural climatology. Cultural climatology seeks to explore the dialectic between society and atmosphere, weather and climate at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A new visual approach to cultural climatology is presented as a possible way of stimulating conversations across the divide between the social and physical sciences. Images and visualisation assert their presence in the understanding, modelling and communication of many nature/culture debates, highlighting a need both for visual literacy across geography, and for social and physical scientists to share their visual methodologies. Cultural climatologists, like other scientists, need visual methodologies for both the critical construction and deconstruction of the images they wish to present and with which they are confronted. To illustrate the importance of visual literacy for cultural climatologists this paper introduces a sample of works from three artists: Constable, Monet and Eliasson. It shows how an exploration of their work (via a theory of pictures) could help to provide: firstly a methodology for understanding the cultural symbolism of skies and weather; secondly an assessment of the urban atmosphere in London at the turn of the 20th century and thirdly an example of the effective representation of atmosphere, weather and climate involving public participation and understanding. Lessons learned from deconstructing these works of art will then be used to suggest improvements in the visualisation of weather in the production and consumption of weather forecasts (thus, picturing theory). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This 'visual grammar' is an account of the meaning-making resources of images that has been developed by Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen. The basic ideas of the visual grammar are firstly illustrated with a description of images mainly selected from the picture book, Zoo by the British author, Anthony Browne. The focus is then on the picture books of David Wiesner and the ways in which the grammar of visual design can be used to enhance discussions of the author's visual narrative techniques. What is proposed here is that developing students' understanding of the Kress and van Leeuwen concepts of visual design will allow them to engage in more productive analysis of the pictorial aspects of Wiesner's and other artists' picture books, both in book format and in the readily available websites with activities using Wiesner's and others' picture book art. © International Association for the Improvement of Mother Tongue Education.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908096561

We postulated that children learn about representational awareness and pictorial conventions through exposure to images in children’s picture books and their visual experiences in the world. We wanted to know whether the images characteristic of children’s respective culture manifest in their drawings. Our methodology included drawing, writing, and open ended discussion in response to picture books. A qualitative, interpretative research approach was used to review the 250 drawings produced by 52 children from the U.S. and China. One Chinese and one American drawing was selected from each of the five days of the study. This small subset of 10 drawings provided insight into: (a) how visual and verbal entities found in the picture books influence the children’s productions, and (b) whether cultural dimensions are embedded in children’s meaning-making activities. In addition to interpreting these selected samples, this chapter also includes information on some common patterns and similarities as well as atypical patterns and differences across and within the American and Chinese sets of drawings. The findings reveal that young children are capable creators of artistic forms and meaning. Although pathways into visual literacy often begin with exposure to picture books, a child’s imagination, cultural influences, and the work of peers who are in close proximity join forces as children re-represent meaning through their drawings. We conclude by stating that young children’s visual representations can provide teachers and researchers with additional or alternative ways of understanding children’s construction of reading and writing. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891619413

Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the need for expression in e-mail and the development of a personalised e-mail system. A survey is carried out to comprehend the derived meanings from visuals; as a result the prototype is formed. Findings - This paper presents a prototype which utilises the idea of reading pictures as sentences and the semiotic and linguistic meaning derived from those sentences. The system aims to interpret the sender's thoughts and convey their emotion and personality through a combination of graphical components, image, and expressive typography. In contrast with the new developing successful language that is rapidly spreading in the use of mobile devices, this personalized e-mail introduces a visual language that people will acquire in using their e-mails. Initial findings are presented from exercises of visual literacy, where the viewer has to play a series of matching games with words and images in order to derive each user's meanings and interpretations. Research limitations/implications - This interactive piece is attempting to transform the static nature of e-mail into a more dynamic form that can offer new ways to interpret verbal information visually. The device will instill the user's message with more authentic personalities and expressions. Practical implications - Cognitive semiotics is something designers explore over time with intuition and experience. Introducing and equipping young designers in college, with regard to semiotics would speed up this essential and unavoidable mental process.

One productive route of approach, I suggest in this chapter, is through visual literacy. I It is not unusual for faculty raised on alphabetic literacy and educated to teach composition before the advent of image-capturing software, multimedia texts, and the World Wide Web to feel inadequate to the task of teaching students about new media texts and the emerging literacies associated with these texts. Many have used computers extensively in the composition instruction they offer students, but most, if not all, of the assignments they favor regularly depend on the alphabetic, demand it as a primary focus, have - in most cases - been limited to it. In part, faculty may limit their teaching in this way because they lack familiarity with a range of new media texts that they consider appropriate for study in composition classrooms. Given their educational backgrounds and expertise, after all, most faculty remain book readers, primarily. Further, although they may have encountered some new media texts, and may even enjoy these texts in many ways, they may not be convinced that such texts are worth further study in the English composition classroom. In addition, faculty may feel that they lack the analytical skills they need to conduct serious study of these texts, an effective vocabulary and set of strategies for discussing the structure and composition of new media texts, or that they lack expertise with the software packages typically used to create such texts - Macromedia Director™ and Dreamweaver™, Adobe Photoshop™ and Premiere™, Corel Poser™ and Bryce™, among others. Importantly, operating from these constraints, many English composition faculty realize that they can offer only limited help to students who read new media texts; and they cannot help students who want to compose such texts. And, as the work of scholars as diverse as Manuel Castells, Gail Hawisher, and The New London Group suggests, this illiteracy can be costly in terms of faculty's understanding of the ways in which communication is changing at the beginning of the 21st century. Perhaps more importantly, however, it may have a cost for the students in their classes - individuals who need to learn more about the new media literacies now being used to shape meaning and information as it is composed and exchanged. To work toward a better understanding of new media texts - and to open composition classes to some of the expanded possibilities suggested by such texts - a good first step may involve focusing on visual literacy and on texts, both online and in print, that depend primarily on visual elements and materials. My reasoning in suggesting this approach is simple, but then so, too, is my level of skill in this new area: one of the primary elements that make new media texts new for me - and at times difficult to discuss in a composition classroom - is their heavy dependence on visual communication. This is an area in which I, personally, feel less than confident as a teacher of English composition, given our profession's historical focus on alphabetic literacy and uncertainty about whether visual studies is an appropriate focus for composition classrooms (cf., George; Sean Williams). Therefore, like most of my colleagues, I have only limited ability to help students analyze the visual elements of text and even less in helping them create texts composed of such elements. Given this context, I suspect if we can help teachers become more knowledgeable and comfortable in working with students to read, discuss, and compose texts that depend primarily on visual elements, they will also be increasingly willing and able to apply these understandings to the teaching of new media texts as well. For me, focusing on the visual in composition classrooms is a productive first step - albeit not the only route - toward the larger goal of focusing on new media texts in the same environment. This chapter, then, seeks to provide a brief rationale and several specific strategies for integrating visual literacy into composition classrooms - both in terms of consumption and production. Most teachers thinking about integrating visual literacy into composition classes need some definitional focus for their efforts. And although, as Diana George notes, the definitions of visual literacy - and the related terms of visual communication, visual rhetoric, and the visual - remain under formulation in our profession, it may be useful to pose a temporary working definition for some of the key terms in this chapter, while recognizing that the larger professional effort to settle on a formal acceptable definition will continue to go forward. By visual literacy, then, I will refer to the ability to read, understand, value, and learn from visual materials (still photographs, videos, films, animations, still images, pictures, drawings, graphics) - especially as these are combined to create a text - as well as the ability to create, combine, and use visual elements (e.g., colors, forms, lines, images) and messages for the purposes of communicating (cf. Kress and van Leeuwven, Reading Images; Debes and Williams; The On-line Visual Literacy Project). And - although I understand some of the problems posed by using the lens of alphabetic literacy to understand visual literacy (Wysocki and Johnson-Eilola) - based on the work of scholars such as Brian Street, James Gee, Harvey Graff, Deborah Brandt (""Literacy Learning""), and David Barton and Mary Hamilton, for the purpose of this chapter, I will assume, further, that visual literacy (or literacies), like all literacies, are both historically and culturally situated, constructed, and valued. By texts that depend primarily on visual elements, visual texts, and visual compositions, I will refer to communications (e.g., visual poems, visual essays, visual messages, visual arguments, collages, multimedia presentations, among other forms) that people compose/design (both online and in print environments) in which visual elements and materials assume the primary burden of communication. I will also use the term the visual, to refer broadly to a focus on visual elements and materials of communication, and the term visual compositions to refer to the texts that individuals or groups design/compose, primarily of visual elements and materials, for the purposes of communicating. Finally, I will use the term composer/designer, instead of ""author"" or ""artist,"" for instance, to describe an individual who produces or creates a visual text and the term design/compose to describe the complex set of activities involved in such a creative and strategic task. To refer to the reader of visual texts, I will use the term reader/viewer and, for the complex set of activities associated with understanding and interpreting a visual text, I will use reading/viewing. Although I understand these terms have their own limitations, I believe they are suggestive of the richness of visual compositions and will provide teachers some help, even if on a temporary basis, in reading this chapter.

Scholars and media observers alike have bemoaned the deleterious effects of television imagery in political spot ads. In light of the increased capability of technology to distort the messages in political spots, this study tests whether or not distortions in visual imagery in televised political ads have any identifiable effect on voters. Methods. The study uses experimental tests of distorted spots and their nondistorted counterparts to determine effects of distortions. Results. Results show that the computer and video manipulations often used in spots do affect voters in predicted ways: Spots with distortions result in higher evaluations and vote likelihood for the sponsoring candidate and lower evaluations and vote likelihood for the opponent. Surprisingly, the visual literacy level of the voter did not mitigate these effects. Conclusions. These findings suggest that new technologies are making it possible for candidates to enhance their own images and to decrease those of the opponent in ways that may be damaging tc the goals of informed decision making in the electoral process.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-17044452415

We make countless decisions every day based on our perception and interpretation of these things, yet we are unaware of what, why and how we respond to visual imagery.

The problem is that no one has given us a greater ability to use and understand all this new information. In our rush to use enticing new tools, we have forgotten our goal: that this is all about quality communication.

Cost per copy is still a major factor but one that is offset by convenience and the capability of including a small number of crucial color illustrations for low run laboratory manuals. Overhead transparencies and color displays are other major educational applications in which electronically generated color hardcopy is just starting to make an impact. Color hardcopy has been perceived as out of reach to the average educator because of probatively high costs in the recent past. Another reason for the underutilization of color in instruction is research that suggests that color distracts instead of directing attention among learners. Much of this research compares visuals which are designed to convey simple visual information, and in this case complexity does often get in the way of comprehension. Color can also act as an advanced organizer that directs visual perception and comprehension to specific instructional objectives. Color can elicit emotional responses from viewers which will assist them in remembering visual detail. Not unlike any other instructional tool, color can add or distract from instructional objectives. Now that color is more accessible in the hard copy format, there are many new ways it can be utilized to benefit the public or corporate educator. In the sections that follow color hard copy is considered in its present areas of application, in context to the suitability of visuals for instruction, as a important component of visual literacy and lastly in the development of measures of picture readability.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029454113
