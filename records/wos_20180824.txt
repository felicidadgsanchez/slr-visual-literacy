The teaching and learning processes of human anatomy are based on the use of graphics, and a spacial perception of the human body is required. Nevertheless, it has been little addressed, and there are no works of assessment of methodologies to improve it in Primary teacher training. This work has been carried out with 194 preservice teachers, and besides an initial diagnosis of the visual literacy skills in human anatomy, the impact of visualization and modelization of the human body to improve it are contrasted. The production of a cross section human diagram has been used as pre and post test. The results show limited skills in visual literacy related to the production of this type of sections, and a higher impact of producing scaled models on learning.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1697-011X			WOS:000439905100015		J	Hristov, Nickolay; Strohecker, Carol; Allen, Louise; Merson, Martha								Designing for Broad Understanding of Science Insights from Practice								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				58	1			113	126		10.1093/icb/icy033					JUL 2018	2018	With the acceleration and increasing complexity of macro-scale problems such as climate change, the need for scientists to ensure that their work is understood has become urgent. As citizens and recipients of public funds for research, scientists have an obligation to communicate their findings in ways many people can understand. However, developing translations that are broadly accessible without being "dumbed down" can be challenging. Fortunately, tenets of visual literacy, combined with narrative methods, can help to convey scientific knowledge with fidelity, while sustaining viewers' interest. Here we outline strategies for such translating, with an emphasis on visual approaches. Among the examples is an innovative, National Science Foundation-funded professional development initiative in which National Park rangers use scientists' imagery to create compelling explanations for the visiting public. Thoughtful visualizations based on interpretive images, motion pictures, 3D animations and augmented, immersive experiences complement the impact of the natural resource and enhance the role of the park ranger. The visualizations become scaffolds for participatory exchanges in which the ranger transcends the traditional roles of information-holder and presenter, to facilitate provocative conversations that provide members of the public with enjoyable experiences and well-founded bases for reflection and ultimately understanding. The process of generating the supporting visualizations benefits from partnerships with design professionals, who develop opportunities for engaging the public by translating important scientific findings and messages in compelling and memorable ways.

Notes on information and library science								E-CIENCIAS DE LA INFORMACION				8	2						10.15517/eci.v8i2.29956					JUL-DEC 2018	2018	This essay provides a definition about image as a source of information and communication, based on the idea that images (mainly digital images) have become essential in the process of communication and information transmission in globalized societies. Consequently, the image builds a visual culture developed from the signs and elements transmitted by a visual language. This essay is aimed at identifying relationships between the images, as source of information and communication, with library and information science. Moreover, it emphasizes methods and techniques of information retrieval and content-based analysis, and suggestions for the process of human and automatic indexing of visual information sources. Both, Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) technology, as well the importance of Visual Literacy for the information and library science are addressed. The essay concludes that the role of the image today, as an element of communication and transmission of information, must be reconsidered and confronted by the information and library science.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1659-4142			WOS:000437560200001		J	Weinraub, Jennifer Yao								Harder to Find Than Nemo: The Elusive Image Citation Standard								COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRARIES				79	4			480	498		10.5860/crl.79.4.480					MAY 2018	2018	New image citation standards need to be developed for college and graduate students to meet visual literacy standards.

This article draws on appraisal theory and original research to illustrate the power of digital animation for multimodal literacy learning. Students from a culturally diverse cohort were taught how to interpret emotions in animated films and produced 2-D cartoon animations using drawings with an iPad application and stylus. The findings show that impassioned multimodal communication is enhanced by knowledge of how feelings produce different facial expressions, gestures, body movements, and physiological changes in characters that are often exaggerated to powerful effect in animations. This includes an ability to invoke different intensities of emotions. The research has significant implications for engaging adolescents in the multimodal communication of emotions and feelings through vocabulary, images, and body language.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000430810300003		J	Pantaleo, Sylvia								Learning About and Through Picturebook Artwork								READING TEACHER				71	5			557	567		10.1002/trtr.1653					MAR-APR 2018	2018	Picturebooks are highly sophisticated multimodal ensembles. Understanding the semiotic resources and affordances of the visual mode to represent and communicate meaning is fundamental to appreciating the artistry and complexity of picturebooks. A recent classroom-based research project with grade 2 students featured explicit instruction on particular elements of visual art and design to develop and enhance students' visual competences and aesthetic appreciation and understanding of picturebooks. In addition to being provided with multiple opportunities to talk and write about picturebook artwork, the students created their own multimodal print texts. The students' composition of this multimodal work required them to intentionally apply the focus elements of visual art and design featured during the study. Examples of students' writing, talking, and artwork reveal how they remade meaning across modes as they described, explained, interpreted, and analyzed visual images in both the picturebooks and their own multimodal texts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000426294500006		J	Kassinis, George; Panayiotou, Alexia								Visuality as Greenwashing: The Case of BP and Deepwater Horizon								ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT				31	1			25	47		10.1177/1086026616687014					MAR 2018	2018	We use a visual semiotic approach to explore how BP utilized the power of the visual after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Through the careful construction and use of images on its corporate website, BP narrated a visual story that helped the company construct a logic of representation when its logic of practice became problematic and heavily scrutinized. We argue that the BP case has wider applicability in understanding how companies deploy the visual to create a reality that averts the limelight from risky practices, aid their post-disaster image restoration efforts, or even enhance greenwashing practices when decoupling is exposed. The study adds to a growing literature that raises the importance of visual literacy for both management practitioners and researchers of organizations. It also adds to the literature on greenwashing by showcasing the role of visual imagery in shaping green communication.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1086-0266	1552-7417		WOS:000425035700002		J	Errazuriz, Luis; Portales, Carlos								The Visual Differences of the Classroom Walls in Chilean Primary Schools								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION				37	1	SI		88	100		10.1111/jade.12130					FEB 2018	2018	In a world increasingly saturated with images, the visual aesthetic dimension should play a more important role in the educational processes. Furthermore, classroom walls could be considered valuable resources to introduce visual literacy among children and teachers. However, Chilean educational policies tend not to pay much attention to visual culture in the classroom. Hence, the selection of visual images displayed on classroom walls as well as the way they are exhibited should be more carefully thought through. Under the assumption that visual resources are pedagogically significant elements, the present investigation examined the images displayed on the classroom walls of the first year of primary schools in the district of Penalolen in Santiago, Chile. We present a comparative analysis of visual environments found in different administrative types of schools (municipal, subsidised and fully private schools), using a qualitative method, as well as a quantification of the sample schools. The analysis shows that inequality between types of schools reproduces in images, favouring private schools in aspects such as the degree of planning of the visual environment, student participation in terms of production, the aesthetic quality of the images and its iconographic variety.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1476-8062	1476-8070		WOS:000424818300009		J	Carlito, M.

Educators are finally realizing that composing in more than one mode is not only important, but also necessary. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of the academic library, the ACRL Framework and information literacy instruction in creating ethical, inspired users.Design/methodology/approach - This paper looks at previously published work on multimodal discourse. how libraries have supported modes in the past and how the ACRL Information Literacy Framework highlights the need to teach students and faculty how to compose in many modes.Findings - Librarians are already well-versed in many literacies, including information, visual and media. They are familiar with multimodal tools and the ethical issues related to the use of images, videos and sound files. While professors are proficient in subject matter, librarians are experts in the paradigm shift from print to multiple modes; therefore, by teaching faculty and students to locate, evaluate, use ethically and cite various modes, librarians become the primary resource on campus for creating multimodal artifacts. The strata used by Kress and Van Leeuwen, coupled with the ACRL Framework, are a model for future instructional design.Originality/value - While much has been written on visual literacy, little is written on library support of multimodal discourse or combining several modes in one argument. This paper is alone in reviewing the past support of multimodal literacy in libraries and gives some sample activities for use in the academic library.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-7324	2054-1716		WOS:000442236000002		J	Stoerger, Sharon								Writing without words: Designing for a visual learning experience								EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION				34	1			7	13		10.3233/EFI-189002					2018	2018	Due to the large number of students, instructors teaching high enrollment courses often rely on traditional assignments such as scantron exams and research papers. While these types of assignments are functional and satisfy a purpose, they are typically not meaningful or pleasurable for students. In an introductory information technology course, the final paper was redesigned to focus on visuals rather than on written words. The redesigned visual learning experience - a digital infographic - gave students the opportunity to rely primarily on images rather than text to communicate their message about an emerging technology to an external audience. Throughout this creation process, where students had to analyze and synthesize complex information, they gained new understanding about their topic as they were thinking and making. Further, this experience had personal significance to the students - one that gave them a sense of pride and accomplishment. The students also recognized that their unique digital artifact had a life beyond the classroom, and they wanted to share their creation with others.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-8329	1875-8649		WOS:000443282600003		J	강유진								A Study on a Literacy Education Model Using Movies from the Original Novel			소설 원작 영화를 활용한 리터러시 교육 모형 연구					The Studies of Korean Literature	우리문학연구			59				59	84							2018	2018	In ​​writing education related to media literacy, images have tended to be used as supplementary devices. Typically, film appreciation / criticism writing can be referenced. The Z generation is a so-called video generation and writing education for these students needs to be taken in a different direction than that which is provided by existing teaching methods.Currently, literacy is defined as a complex cognitive, thinking, and expression process mediated by language, not a writing-oriented ability to interpret language as a means of expression. In this sense, literacy education should focus on education as a way of developing expressive capabilities that are appropriate to each mode of expression, beyond writing, image, and video. Ultimately, it should aim to improve language, thinking, and expression, regardless of the way they are represented. To accomplish this, instances in which writing is rejected by the generation which favors images must be reduced. This is possible through an educational model which focuses on the transfer of image data through writing, based on the fact that both image and text are linear, cognitive, and linguistic parts of the thinking process.This educational model focuses on providing students with the opportunity to learn the differences in the expression of texts and images through hands-on conversions of novels corresponding to ‘Explanation / Describe / Narrative / Demonstration’ do. Through this approach, students can experience the difference / similarity between semantics and expressions when texts are converted into images and perform integrated reading (decoding) and writing (encoding) of texts and images.				미디어 리터러시에 관련한 글쓰기 교육은 영상의 보조적 활용에 그친 경향이 있어 왔으며 대표적으로 영화 감상문/비평문 쓰기의 형태로 가장 많이 이루어져 왔다. Z세대는 이른바 영상세대이며 이들을 대상으로 하는 글쓰기 교육은 기존의 교육 방식에서 전면적으로 다른 방향에서 이루어질 필요가 있다.현재 리터러시는 언어를 표현 수단으로 하는 글 중심의 해독력이 아니라 언어를 매개로 한 복합적 인지, 사고, 표현 과정으로 정의할 수 있다. 이렇게 볼 때 리터러시 교육은 글, 영상, 이미지 등의 표현 방식을 넘어서서 각각의 표현 수단에 맞는 표현의 방식을 교육하는 데 초점을 맞추고, 궁극적으로는 표현 방식을 막론하고 이를 활용한 언어적 인지, 사고, 표현 능력을 향상하는 데 목적으로 두어야 한다. 이를 위해 선행되어야 할 것은 영상세대가 갖고 있는 글에 대한 거부감을 줄이는 것이다. 이는 영상과 글이 모두 선형적인 인지, 사고 과정의 언어적 행위라는 사실을 바탕으로 글쓰기를 통해 영상 자료를 글로 옮기는 것에 주목하는 교육 모델을 통해 가능하다.본 교육 모형은 담화 유형 중 ‘설명/ 묘사/ 서사/ 논증’에 해당하는 소설 예문을 영상으로 전환하고, 영상을 다시 글로 전환하는 실습을 통해 글과 영상의 표현에 나타나는 차이를 익히는 것을 주된 내용으로 한다. 이를 통해 학생들은 글이 영상으로 전환되었을 때의 의미와 표현 방식의 차이/유사성을 체험 학습하고 문자와 영상의 통합적 읽기(decoding)와 쓰기(encoding)를 수행할 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-7429			KJD:ART002372107		J	Hosic, Irfan								Contemporary Art and the Media after 9/11								ZIVOT UMJETNOSTI					102			98	118		10.31664/zu.2018.102.04					2018	2018	The collapse of the Twin Towers in 2001 and its direct transmission around the globe introduced a new paradigm in warfare conducted through the media. The time span between the first and the second attack on WTC was a suitable moment for the cameramen and photographers to install their equipment and make it possible for the viewers to watch the second airplane crushing into the towers live. The disturbing images travelled around the world in no time, and their character shifted from documentary to symbolical. The resulting hypertrophy of meaning led to an image production encoded with the explicit content of violence and trauma. The newly created media setting generated new viewing mentalities and new visual literacy. Art produced in the period since September 11, 2001 has been an indicator of the new social order, which endows images with the brutal power of reality.The aim of this paper is to present some examples from the contemporary artistic production- primarily works of Hans Peter Feldmann, Doug Ashford, Francis Alys, Thomas Hirschorn, and Munir Fatmi- and to perform an analysis of the way in which the contemporary art practices deal with the issues imposed by the post-September eruption of images. The works of the said artists have thereby been used as primary sources in articulating a perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the new role of the media.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0514-7794			WOS:000439064200004		J	박인창								A Case Study on the Visual Literacy of Creative Printing Advertisements			창의적인 인쇄광고의 비쥬얼 리터러시에 관한 사례 연구					A Treatise on The Plastic Media	조형미디어학			21	2			53	60							2018	2018	Today, many of the countless advertisements in our country are amazed at the bright ideas and outstanding technical completeness of the year, but many of the advertisements don't even make it into our heads. With the development of the media, we dare say the amount of advertising we encounter has exploded, while the level has been normalized. Put it mildly, it's like looking at a cotton candy with a hollow stomach. There are many causes, but first, I would like to point to a bizarre market structure led by a few big advertisers, including telecommunications and construction companies. They are brainwashing the people with massive attacks. Instead of developing ideas to convey the brand's core values, it seems to only stimulate the eyes and ears of consumers with bizarre expressions. People often talk about the rules that make great advertisements. There are some students in my class who ask such questions seriously. Unfortunately, they don't exist. Rather, if you look at the great advertisements in detail, you realize that all of the rules have come out of them. Behind great advertising is great processes, and after great processes, great people exist. The study looked at the importance and necessity of creative print advertising and described the characteristics of printed media that are still in existence.And I would like to cite examples of the visual literacy of creative print ads. In the era of global free trade, the way in which images are presented has been divided into categories based on cases in which people empathize with the cultural differences between countries.				오늘날 우리나라에 쏟아지는 수많은 광고들을 보고 있노라면 기발한 발상과 뛰어난 기술적 완성도에 놀라곤 하지만, 광고를 보고 나서도 브랜드가 무엇이었는지 머릿속에 남지 않은 경우가 많다. 미디어의 발달과 더불어 우리가 접하는 광고의 양은 폭발적으로 증가한 반면 그 수준은 하향평준화 되었다고 감히 말할 수 있다. 좀 심하게 말 하면, 속이 텅 비어있는 솜사탕을 보는 느낌이라고나 할까. 여러 가지 원인이 있겠지만 우선 이동 통신, 건설 회사 등 몇몇의 대형 광고주가 주도하고 있는 기이한 시장 구조를 들고 싶다. 그들은 어마어마한 물량공세로 국민들을 세뇌시키고 있다. 브랜드의 핵심 가치를 전달하는 아이디어를 개발하기보다는 그저 희한한 표현으로 소비자들의 눈과 귀만을 자극하려는 것 같다. 사람들은 종종 위대한 광고를 만드는 규칙들에 대해 이야기한다. 제가 진행하는 수업에서도 진지하게 그런 질문을 하는 학생들이 있다. 하지만 아쉽게도 그런 규칙은 존재하지 않는다. 오히려 위대 한 광고들을 자세히 관찰하면 거기서 모든 규칙들이 쏟아져 나왔다는 것을 깨닫게 된다. 위대한 광고 뒤 에는 위대한 과정이 존재하며, 위대한 과정 뒤에는 위대한 사람들이 존재한다. 본 연구는 창의적인  인쇄광고의 중요성과 필요성을 살펴보고 아직도 사라지지 않는 인쇄매체의 특성을 서술하였다. 그리고 창의성 높은 인쇄광고의 비쥬얼 리터러시의 사례를 제시하고자 한다. 글로벌 자유무역의 시대에 함축적인 이미지의 전달 방법은 국가 간 문화적 차이를 뛰어넘어서 모두를 공감시킨 사례를 중심으로 그 범주를 분류하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-5558			KJD:ART002352395		J	염은영								How Visual Thinking Strategies Using Picture Book Images can Improve Korean Secondary EFL Students’ L2 Writing								English Teaching	영어교육			73	1			23	48		10.15858/engtea.73.1.201803.23					2018	2018	This research aims to explore whether guided visual artwork discussions called Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) using picture book images can benefit and enhance Korean EFL secondary students’ L2 writing. Incorporating content analysis, this research examines how carefully guided artwork discussions can enhance visual understanding, critical thinking skills and interpretive L2 writing skills. The L2 writing samples of the focal students revealed that they were able to think based on visual clues. The discussions were led by the teacher who pointed out significant visual elements and allowed time for the students to explore diverse ideas. The focal students were able to piece together the jigsaw of the images and articulate their thoughts in English, during which time they learned to take risks and to make mistakes in using a foreign language. Their critical comments and improved L2 writing suggest how critical/aesthetic thinking skills can be developed through continued visual practices in a secondary EFL setting.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1017-7108			KJD:ART002334397		J	Lopatovska, Irene; Carcamo, Tiffany; Dease, Nicholas; Jonas, Elijah; Kot, Simen; Pamperien, Grace; Volpe, Anthony; Yalcin, Kurt								Not just a pretty picture part two: testing a visual literacy program for young children								JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION				74	3			588	607		10.1108/JD-08-2017-0119					2018	2018	Purpose In an effort to advance visual literacy (VL) education, the purpose of this paper is to develop and test a VL instruction program for 2.5-4-year-old children in a public library setting.Design/methodology/approach The study was designed as a series of VL workshops for young public library visitors. Each workshop collected information about children's existing VL knowledge, introduced them to new visual concepts, and measured their engagement and comprehension of the newly acquired material. The study data were collected via questionnaires and observations.Findings Most of the children who participated in the study workshops showed a solid baseline knowledge of colors, lines, shapes and textures and were actively engaged in instruction. After the instruction, children generally showed an improved understanding of the newly introduced VL concepts and were able to answer questions related to the new concepts, recognize them in images, and apply them in art projects.Research limitations/implications The study relied on a relatively small sample of library visitors in an affluent neighborhood. The findings are influenced by variations in the topics and delivery methods of instruction. The study findings might not be generalizable beyond the US context.Practical implications The study methods and findings would be useful to VL educators who work with children.Social implications As information continues to proliferate in non-textual contexts, VL is becoming an increasingly important educational goal. The study advances a VL agenda and advocates for introducing VL early in life.Originality/value The authors are not aware of any other study that tested VL instruction on a group of very young children in a public library.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0418	1758-7379		WOS:000428538600007		J	Damyanov, Ivo; Tsankov, Nikolay								The Role of Infographics for the Development of Skills for Cognitive Modeling in Education								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING				13	1			82	92		10.3991/ijet.v13i01.7541					2018	2018	Contemporary culture is a visual culture. Visual images become the predominant form of communication. Students should be visually literate and be able to read and use visual language, to decode, interpret and evaluate visual messages successfully, and, last but not least, to encode and compose meaningful visual communication. The combination of modeling with other methods in scientific knowledge increases its potential as a cognitive method. Infographics can play a significant role in the process as tool or target according to the age and cognitive abilities of the students. Information images (infographics) are visual representations of information, data or knowledge. The use of infographics as a modeling method can develop different cognitive skills such as interpretation, analysis, assessment, conclusion, explanation, which are all part of the modeling process. In fact, they can be a tool for achieving the next stage of literacy-visual literacy. All this necessitates the exploration of infographics as an instrument in the development of a comprehensive system of cognitive tasks in education related to the formation of skills for modeling. In the paper, six types of cognitive tasks in education are analyzed as well as their relation to the visual literacy competence standards approved by the Association of College & Research Libraries. A comparison of freely available infographics tools is provided and the suitability of different infographics templates is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1863-0383			WOS:000425245700006		J	이영미								Visual Literacy of Nonverbal Communication represented in Visual Communication - Focused on Iconotext -			비주얼커뮤니케이션에서 나타나는 비언어적 커뮤니케이션의시각적 문해력(비주얼 리터러시visual literacy)에 관한 연구- 아이코노텍스트(iconotext)를 중심으로 -					Korea Science & Art Forum	한국과학예술포럼			32				205	216		10.17548/ksaf.2018.01.30.205					2018	2018	The way people communicate is rapidly changing with the times while media are expanding every day. Therefore, both verbal and non-verbal factors in visual communication become diverse in their expression making the message it delivers ambiguous. This study begins from the iconotext as a nonverbal factor in visual communication. The purpose of this study is to understand the concept of iconotext, consisting of text and images and having a symbolic or complex meaning, and to examine its characteristics and types, and visible literacy as an image-text.The results of this study are summarized as follows. Literacy means the ability to read and write but recently the term’s meaning has been expanded to include that of using text and image to create and understand messages, namely the ability of human communication in all areas. Visual media has appeared with the emergence of visual language as an important communication tool and the decline of written language. Along with this trend, visual literacy is becoming increasingly important to read visual information fast and accurately, to adopt and sort out messages, and to create visual messages. In particular, the characteristics of iconotext, as the non-verbal elements of communication where texts and images coexist, by keeping distance between visual elements and verbal elements; the two elements are not mixed up but confronted, from which tension arises. The momentary tension lies in the dynamism where the code systems of the text and image are put in contrast or just a position. As the iconotext is text and image at the same time, this ambiguity and intertextuality lead to the possibility of multiple interpretations, hence the necessity of visual literacy in reading iconotext.Building on these findings, in visual communication, the distinction between text and image, reading and seeing, verbal and visual, is increasingly blurring. It can be said that in an era of “text-image”, an image presupposes a text, and vice versa. Future studies should explore a new type of visual literacy ― the visual literacy of the third text-image in an era of new media ― with which one can understand a cross-boundary cultural phenomenon where text and image, and words and forms coexist and blend.				시대변화에 따른 미디어의 확장과 커뮤니케이션의형태가 급변하고 있다. 그에 따라 비주얼커뮤니케이션에서의 언어적 요소와 비언어적 요소의 표현과 방법도 다양해지면서 시각적 이미지의 메시지 전달도 모호해졌다. 본 연구는 비주얼커뮤니케이션에서 나타나는 비언어적 요소인 아이코노텍스트(iconotext)에서부터 시작되었다. 연구의 목적은 글과 그림이 같이 존재하면서도 하나의 상징적인 또는 복합적인 의미를 가지고 있는 아이코노텍스트의 개념이해와 특징 및 유형 그리고 이미지 텍스트로서의 시각적 문해력(비주얼 리터러시visual literacy)에 대해 고찰하였다.본 연구의 내용 및 결과는 다음과 같다. 문해력(리터러시literacy)은 문자 언어를 읽고 쓸 수 있는 능력으로 사용되지만, 최근에는 개념이 확대되어 문자나이미지를 사용하여 메시지를 이해하고 만들어 낼 수있는 인간의 모든 커뮤니케이션 영역의 능력으로 확장되고 있다. 시각적 미디어는 문자언어의 퇴조와 시각이미지언어의 막강한 영향력으로 나타나게 되었다.이러한 시각이미지 정보를 빠르고 바르게 해독하고- 208 - 메시지를 수용하고 선별하며 시각적 메시지를 생산해내는 시각적 문해력은 더욱 중요해지고 있다. 특히 글과 그림이 공존하는 비언어적 요소인 아이코노텍스트의 특성은 조형 요소와 구두 요소 사이의 거리를 유지하는데 있으며, 이 두 요소는 서로 혼동되지 않으면서도 순간적인 대치를 통해 긴장을 하게 되는데 이것이 글과 그림의 기호체계를 대립시키거나 병치시키는역동성에 있다고 하였다. 이는 아이코노텍스트가 문자이면서도 그림인 모호성에서부터 상호텍스트성으로인하여 다의적 해석을 불러일으키는 것이다.이러한 연구 결과를 바탕으로 비주얼커뮤니케이션에서 비언어적 요소인 아이코노텍스트의 시각적 문해력은 텍스트와 이미지, 읽는 것과 보는 것, 언어적인것과 시각적인 것의 경계는 점점 모호해지고 있다. 이는 텍스트이미지(texteimage) 시대에 텍스트는 이미지를 염두에 두는 텍스트가 되고, 이미지는 텍스트를 염두에 두는 이미지가 되는 것이다. 아이코노텍스트의시각적 문해력은 읽고 이해하는 것과는 달리 이미지와 문자 그리고 형상과 언어가 서로 공존하고 융합하는 탈경계적 문화현상을 해독할 수 있는 새로운 시각적 문해력, 즉 새로운 미디어 시대에 제3의 텍스트 이미지의 비주얼 미디어 리터러시에 대한 후속 연구가필요하겠다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			2005-1409			KJD:ART002312060		J	Sterno, Linda; Bjork, Klara								Redirecting the gaze: Film education in an individualistic era								JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CINEMAS				9	2-3			151	168		10.1386/jac.9.2-3.151_1					DEC 1 2017	2017	This article offers consideration to an alternative use of film practice and the role of pedagogy in challenging the conception of film as a product and entertainment medium. Instead the authors reflect on the potential of the camera as a tool for facilitating dialogue with communities and individuals, which allows student filmmakers to draw on images and representations that challenge the stereotyped and repetitive images generated in mass media. Furthermore, they draw from their own experiences of working with the visual practice (VP) model where the camera is a research tool. As a tool, the camera is used to explore issues in contemporary society and is related to contextual responsibilities and concerns regarding film pedagogy and its connection to enabling social change, with a broader correlation to civil society that aims to promote democratic rights.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-9221	1754-923X		WOS:000432921700004		J	Okasaki, Aymê; Kanamaru, Antonio Takao								Ensino da arte e desenvolvimento da leitura visual: uso da estamparia têxtil no ensino médio	Art teaching and development of visual reading: use of textile printing in high school							Educação e Pesquisa				44	0			e162822	e162822		10.1590/s1678-4634201711162822					2017-12	2017	Abstract The present study is based on the importance of the process of reading and analyzing artistic and textile visual works for the comprehensive development of students. Our procedures were firstly based on the conceptual framework proposed by Abigail Housen, which states that the process of reading visual languages involve basic development stages, namely narrative, constructive, classifying, interpretative, and re-creative – where the latter indicates the student has acquired and consolidated skills of conscious reading. This framework was combined with the triangular approach developed by Ana M. Barbosa in terms of the need to contextualize, make, and appraise art works. To make a deeper observation of the aesthetic-artistic process, we analyzed visual readings of artistic and textile prints by students and teachers of art and fashion collected in a school environment from 2014 to 2015 and guided by the basic question: “What do you see in this print?”. Thus, we observed the coherence of Housen’s stages of aesthetic development and the need for Barbosa’s triangulation, but we highlight the need and the didactic-pedagogical importance of developing image reading in the context of visual literacy as a way to promote collective expression, discussion and reflection and as an essential process for the development of aesthetic and artistic learning, which we believe leads students’ awareness of themselves, of others, and of the world - the basis for thinking autonomously. Thus it promotes the student’s development as a critical subject and citizen, as indicated by new literature findings.		Resumo Trata-se de estudo baseado na importância do processo de leitura e análise de obras visuais artísticas e têxteis para o desenvolvimento integral do educando. Fundamentamos inicialmente nossos procedimentos a partir do quadro conceitual da autora Abigail Housen, que sustenta que o processo de leitura da linguagem visual pelo educando ocorre por meio de estágios básicos de desenvolvimento: narrativo, construtivo, classificatório, interpretativo e re-criativo, sendo que nesses dois últimos, podemos observar a aquisição e consolidação da leitura consciente pelo educando. Aliamos, em análise, a abordagem triangular da autora Ana Mae Barbosa, quanto à necessidade de contextualizar, fazer e apreciar a obra de arte. Mas, para aprofundamento de nossa observação do processo estético-artístico, analisamos leituras visuais realizadas por estudantes e educadores de ensino de artes e moda, entre 2014 e 2015, em comunidade escolar, a partir de estampas artísticas e têxteis, guiadas pela questão básica: “O que você vê na estampa?”. Observamos assim, a coerência dos estágios de desenvolvimento de Housen, bem como a necessidade de triangulação de Barbosa, mas destacamos a necessidade e a importância didático-pedagógica do desenvolvimento da leitura da imagem enquanto alfabetização visual, como meio para expressão, discussão e reflexão coletivas, processo fundamental para o desenvolvimento da aprendizagem estética e artística que, a nosso ver, possibilita a conscientização do educando quanto a si mesmo, ao outro e ao mundo – base para autonomia do pensamento e, assim, para o desenvolvimento do educando como sujeito crítico e cidadão, conforme novas literaturas indicam.							0	0	0	0	0	0			1678-4634			SCIELO:S1517-97022018000100417		J	Bentwich, Miriam Ethel; Gilbey, Peter								More than visual literacy: art and the enhancement of tolerance for ambiguity and empathy								BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION				17						200	10.1186/s12909-017-1028-7					NOV 10 2017	2017	Background: Comfort with ambiguity, mostly associated with the acceptance of multiple meanings, is a core characteristic of successful clinicians. Yet past studies indicate that medical students and junior physicians feel uncomfortable with ambiguity. Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) is a pedagogic approach involving discussions of art works and deciphering the different possible meanings entailed in them. However, the contribution of art to the possible enhancement of the tolerance for ambiguity among medical students has not yet been adequately investigated. We aimed to offer a novel perspective on the effect of art, as it is experienced through VTS, on medical students' tolerance of ambiguity and its possible relation to empathy.Methods: Quantitative method utilizing a short survey administered after an interactive VTS session conducted within mandatory medical humanities course for first-year medical students. The intervention consisted of a 90-min session in the form of a combined lecture and interactive discussions about art images. The VTS session and survey were filled by 67 students in two consecutive rounds of first-year students.Results.: 67% of the respondents thought that the intervention contributed to their acceptance of multiple possible meanings, 52% thought their visual observation ability was enhanced and 34% thought that their ability to feel the sufferings of other was being enhanced. Statistically significant moderate-to-high correlations were found between the contribution to ambiguity tolerance and contribution to empathy (0.528-0.744; p <= 0.01).Conclusions: Art may contribute especially to the development of medical students' tolerance of ambiguity, also related to the enhancement of empathy. The potential contribution of visual art works used in VTS to the enhancement of tolerance for ambiguity and empathy is explained based on relevant literature regarding the embeddedness of ambiguity within art works, coupled with reference to John Dewey's theory of learning. Given the situational nature of the tolerance for ambiguity in this context, VTS provides a path for enhancing ambiguity tolerance that is less conditioned by character traits. Moreover, the modest form of VTS we utilized, not requesting a significant alteration in the pre-clinical curricula, suggests that enhancing the tolerance of ambiguity and empathy among medical students may be particularly feasible.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1472-6920			WOS:000414976100002	29126410	J	Tranter, Kieran					Tranter, Kieran/0000-0003-1683-2939			Law, the Digital and Time: The Legal Emblems of Doctor Who								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE SEMIOTICS OF LAW-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SEMIOTIQUE JURIDIQUE				30	3	SI		515	532		10.1007/s11196-017-9522-0					SEP 2017	2017	This article is about time. It is about time, or more precisely, about the absence of time in law's digital future. It is also about time travelling and the seemingly ever-popular BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who. Further, it is about law's timefullness; about law's pictorial past and the 'visual baroque' of its chronological fused future. Ultimately, it is about a time paradox of seeing time run to a time when time runs 'No More!' This 'timey-wimey' article is in three parts. The first part looks to a hazy remembered past of the legal emblem tradition as presented in Peter Goodrich's Legal Emblems and the Art of Law to learn visual literacy and also to glimpse the essential elements of modern legality with authority, decision and violence. The second part maps how these images and icons of modern legality are manifest in the Doctor Who fiftieth year anniversary special 'The Day of the Doctor.' The third stage looks beyond these first order meanings to understand the chronological chaos of 'The Day of the Doctor.' The technicity of the image as a portal through time and space that the narrative revolves around charts the implications for the digital end of time for law.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-8059	1572-8722		WOS:000425942500009		J	Gibbard, Nathan								When Is a Priest Not a Priest?

This, however, has often led to a failure to account adequately for the visual component that is a crucial element in talking about graphic narrative, especially when discussing religion and spirituality within comics. By closely examining one religious image within the context of The Incredible Hulk comics, the clerical collar, this article seeks to shed some light on the complexity of dealing with constantly evolving religious visual culture and its relation to religious identity. In this way, the article hopes to open up new lines of inquiry in regard to religion and comics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1703-289X			WOS:000418186500001		J	Vega Garzon, Juan Carlos; Magrini, Marcio Luiz; Galembeck, Eduardo								Using augmented reality to teach and learn biochemistry								BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION				45	5			417	420		10.1002/bmb.21063					SEP-OCT 2017	2017	Understanding metabolism and metabolic pathways constitutes one of the central aims for students of biological sciences. Learning metabolic pathways should be focused on the understanding of general concepts and core principles. New technologies such Augmented Reality (AR) have shown potential to improve assimilation of biochemistry abstract concepts because students can manipulate 3D molecules in real time. Here we describe an application named Augmented Reality Metabolic Pathways (ARMET), which allowed students to visualize the 3D molecular structure of substrates and products, thus perceiving changes in each molecule. The structural modification of molecules shows students the flow and exchange of compounds and energy through metabolism.

In an effort to humanize digital literacies, this department column offers a vast array of topics, from participatory work that pushes educators and researchers to communicate in local and global spaces to ways of redefining core reading and literacy skills through a screen-based, multimodal logic. This column also provides a venue for research and practical applications that depict technology use as a part of the fabric of being human. The column helps educators reconceptualize the ways that children learn with technology, media, and new communication systems; honors educator success stories and burning questions and issues; and reimagines literacy futures.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000408818600016		J	Eich, Milena Schneid; Schulz, Lisiane Ott; Pinheiro, Luciana Santos								AUDIODESCRIÇÃO COMO RECURSO DE ACESSIBILIDADE NO LIVRO DIDÁTICO DE LÍNGUA INGLESA	AUDIODESCRIPTION AS AN ACCESSIBILITY TOOL IN EFL COURSE BOOKS							Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada				56	2			443	459		10.1590/010318138649177273121					2017-08	2017	ABSTRACT Considering the images presented in English language textbooks nowadays, this article aims at analyzing the relevance these images have for the accomplishment of activities by the students.

Figurative images and the activities making use of them were selected from the history units contained in 27 school textbooks (from the subjects of Conocimiento del Medio, a subject encompassing social and natural sciences, and social sciences) from two specific periods: those in which the educational laws known as the 'Ley Organica General del Sistema Educativo' (LOGSE, 1991-2006) and the 'Ley Organica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa' (LOMCE, 2013- present) were in force. The teaching materials studied were published by the most widely-used publishers in each of the stages studied in the geographic area of the Autonomous Community of Valencia. The analysis was carried out via a research method combining quantitative (ex post facto) and qualitative (based on conceptual categories) methods applied to four study criteria: the presence and use of figurative images, the quantity and kind of images used for the activities, the level of cognitive complexity of the activities and the relationships of significance between the images and the text contained in the books. The results obtained demonstrate some clear differences between the textbooks of the different periods studied, combined with an excessive proportion of purely descriptive and acritical activities, which do not promote the development of the aforementioned capacities. This paper also shows that certain educational routines and traditions, such as the disciplinary code of school history teaching are still present and reflected in practice, thus having a negative influence on educational proposals and impeding the advancement of educational innovation in the field of history teaching.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0034-8082	1988-592X		WOS:000406089600005		J	Angel Marzal, Miguel; Borges, Jussara					MARZAL, MIGUEL ANGEL/0000-0003-2039-234X; Borges, Jussara/0000-0003-0157-8691			Evaluative models of Metaliteracy and Information Literacy as factors in academic excellence								REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA				40	3					e184	10.3989/redc.2017.3.1410					JUL-SEP 2017	2017	The paper analyzes the transformation of information literacy from the point of convergence of information competencies and communication competencies.

The Proof is in the Picture: The Influence of Imagery and Experience in Perceptions of Hurricane Messaging								WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY				9	3			471	485		10.1175/WCAS-D-16-0048.1					JUL 2017	2017	Although evidence suggests that photographs can enhance persuasive messaging by offering "proof,'' less research considers their utility relative to other visual forms that ostensibly convey more information but more abstractly. Drawing on communication and information processing theory, this study examines the influence of visual features and personal experience variables in a domain with urgent need to better understand their role: hurricane messaging. In a between subjects experiment, residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut (N = 1052) were exposed to a hypothetical hurricane forecast accompanied by a photograph of storm surge inundating a house (indexical image), a map of projected storm surge (iconic image), or no image (control), depending on condition. Results revealed that participants in the indexical condition perceived the greatest risk overall and were more likely to mention evacuation as a behavioral intention than did those in the iconic and control conditions, controlling for individual differences (gender, state of residence, etc.). Moreover, risk perception was greatest among residents in the indexical condition reporting fewer personal impacts of hurricanes, suggesting a moderating effect of hurricane experience on risk judgment but not on behavioral intention. Consistent with a dual-process model perspective, when exposed to an image of an identifiable "victim,'' participants with less direct experience may have employed an affect heuristic, resulting in heightened risk perceptions. Practically speaking, using evocative photographs as proof may be preferable to a map or text-only approach when warning public audiences of a given hazard, but ethical issues and empirical questions remain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-8327	1948-8335		WOS:000405925000010		J	Courneya, Carol Ann								Illustrating the art of (teaching) medicine								COGENT ARTS & HUMANITIES				4						1335960	10.1080/23311983.2017.1335960					JUN 13 2017	2017	This essay chronicles the multi-year evolution of an art-making project involving first-year medical and dental students. It started as a call for artistic interpretations, through photography, of the cardiac science that the students were learning in their curriculum. On the basis of their initial enthusiasm for the project, and in response to subsequent student's requests, it broadened to include a wide variety of media (photographs, paintings, sketches, sculptures, installations, and videos), but always related to the original cardiac theme. Beyond just pretty pictures many of these images were student interpretations of foundational anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Many required a sophisticated understanding of the structure or function in order to translate the science into art. Some students used clever metaphors and fanciful thinking to create their art. Dental students showed a preference for creating art that required manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination. Completing the circle, this multi-year repository of student-generated cardiac art has been used as vital learning objects in on-going medical school lectures, as an alternative representation of anatomy and physiology. The significance of using art-making as a learning tool in medical/dental training is discussed in this essay.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2331-1983			WOS:000403553500001		J	Cheng, Chu-Yu; Ou, Yang-Kun; Kin, Ching-Lung								How Chinese Semantics Capability Improves Interpretation in Visual Communication								EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION				13	6			2299	2307		10.12973/eurasia.2017.01226a					JUN 2017	2017	A visual representation involves delivering messages through visually communicated images. The study assumed that semantic recognition can affect visual interpretation ability, and the result showed that students graduating from a general high school achieve satisfactory results in semantic recognition and image interpretation tasks than students graduating from a vocational high school. Twenty students with low semantic recognition performance participated in our study and completed 24 hours of an intensive Chinese semantics-training course after the design foundation course. The results revealed that the Chinese intensive training improved their semantic recognition in design performance, thereby is confirming the assumption. Our study results suggest that design teachers must not only provide strong practical design training, but also develop skills such as semantic comprehension and object interpretation in young designers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1305-8215	1305-8223		WOS:000404604700040		J	Oliveira, Alandeom W.; Cook, Kristin					Oliveira, Alandeom/0000-0003-2418-0299			Student Visual Communication of Evolution								RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION				47	3			519	538		10.1007/s11165-016-9515-0					JUN 2017	2017	Despite growing recognition of the importance of visual representations to science education, previous research has given attention mostly to verbal modalities of evolution instruction. Visual aspects of classroom learning of evolution are yet to be systematically examined by science educators. The present study attends to this issue by exploring the types of evolutionary imagery deployed by secondary students. Our visual design analysis revealed that students resorted to two larger categories of images when visually communicating evolution: spatial metaphors (images that provided a spatio-temporal account of human evolution as a metaphorical "walk" across time and space) and symbolic representations ("icons of evolution" such as personal portraits of Charles Darwin that simply evoked evolutionary theory rather than metaphorically conveying its conceptual contents). It is argued that students need opportunities to collaboratively critique evolutionary imagery and to extend their visual perception of evolution beyond dominant images.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0157-244X	1573-1898		WOS:000400833600003		J	Brugar, Kristy A.; Roberts, Kathryn L.

If so, what effect does that instruction and engagement have on students' comprehension of those devices and social studies reading materials that contain them? We worked with teachers and students in a context-embedded PD series that emphasized literacy skills specific to standards that address accessing and sharing information (Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts) as social studies specialists (e.g., historians, geographers, economists; C3 Framework), with a particular focus on the graphical devices commonly found in social studies instructional materials (i.e., captioned images, maps, tables, timelines).

It installs the need on developing a progressive visual literacy. One of the most frequent aids with images employed at classrooms are textbooks. Thus, this article aims at 1) valuing promoted learning on images analysis into textbook's tasks in Chile and Spain and 2) to suggest didactical orientations to its use as graphic documents into social sciences teaching. For the analysis two methodological perspectives were employed, the qualitative and the comparative one. Results show that in both places an increasing analytical and critical use of images is developing, but narrower in Catalonia than in Chile.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1575-0965			WOS:000405456000010		J	English, Jayanne								Canvas and cosmos: Visual art techniques applied to astronomy data								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D				26	4					1730010	10.1142/S0218271817300105					APR 2017	2017	Bold color images from telescopes act as extraordinary ambassadors for research astronomers because they pique the public's curiosity. But are they snapshots documenting physical reality? Or are we looking at artistic spacescapes created by digitally manipulating astronomy images? This paper provides a tour of how original black and white data, from all regimes of the electromagnetic spectrum, are converted into the color images gracing popular magazines, numerous websites, and even clothing. The history and method of the technical construction of these images is outlined. However, the paper focuses on introducing the scientific reader to visual literacy (e.g. human perception) and techniques from art (e.g. composition, color theory) since these techniques can produce not only striking but politically powerful public outreach images. When created by research astronomers, the cultures of science and visual art can be balanced and the image can illuminate scientific results sufficiently strongly that the images are also used in research publications. Included are reflections on how they could feedback into astronomy research endeavors and future forms of visualization as well as on the relevance of outreach images to visual art.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0218-2718	1793-6594		WOS:000395373100002		J	Tolentino, Efleda Preclaro; Lawson, Lauren								"Well, we're going to kindergarten, so we're gonna need business cards!': A story of preschool emergent readers and writers and the transformation of identity								JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD LITERACY				17	1			47	68		10.1177/1468798415605570					MAR 2017	2017	Teacher research yields a plethora of insights about creating a meaningful curriculum for children. In this article, we describe the experience of preschool children who participated in Kindergarten Club, a space that afforded them opportunities to shift roles from being preschoolers to being kindergarteners. Kindergarten Club became a catalyst for engaging in a dialogue about kindergarten, experimenting with print and experiencing literacy learning. Within this context, preschoolers embarked on an investigation that centered around business cards. Business cards ignited interest on the part of preschoolers as they explored their potential for social networking and sharing information. The business card investigation evolved into a curriculum that sparked enquiries into the use of print as mediator for self-representation. Assisted by their teacher and members of the community, preschoolers engaged in collective action to create business cards that would bear imprints of their identity. In the process, young children used their writing abilities, proactively utilizing tools and resources to ensure that their business cards bore authentic representations of themselves. The article conveys the importance of listening on the part of the teacher and trusting children to take the lead in navigating their paths as literacy learners. Documentation in the form of artifacts, images and dialogue reveals how young children naturally incorporate emergent knowledge about literacy and their social worlds into their work as learners. The article provides a gentle reminder of how literacy learning is a joyful process that can be made meaningful and engaging by building upon children's enquiries into the world.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1468-7984	1741-2919		WOS:000394794900003		J	Gabinete, Mari Karen L.								Semiotics in Visual Literacy Pedagogy of Junior High School Teachers in the Philippines								ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS				23	2			1113	1117		10.1166/asl.2017.7511					FEB 2017	2017	This study explored the English/Language arts teacher's beliefs and practices in integrating semiotics in teaching visual literacy to Filipino junior high school students. Six secondary English/Language arts classes in government and non-government schools were observed and their respective teachers interviewed regarding their attitude and conception of visual literacy and knowledge and application of semiotics in processing visual materials. Data were obtained through interview, observations, questionnaire and field notes. The study revealed that majority of teacher-participants were not formally trained in the processing of visual materials despite the use of technology-driven instructional materials on almost a daily basis, primarily as motivation activity and secondly, as a convenient replacement for a traditional text. Generally, teachers were observed to treat visuals, in particular films, as a written text where process questions dealt more on literary elements. Reports from survey revealed that teachers explain concept of semiotics and expressed as giving more importance to perspective and mood and less to lighting and social distance. Generally, all teacher-participants agree that creating meaning out of symbols or images open up opportunities for critical comments and intellectual discussions. However, analysis of images was not demonstrated in practice and concept of semiotics was implicitly demonstrated although the teacher seems unaware of it.

Considering the place of the image, it is now important to take more account of its contribution in teaching and learning in a university context (Serafini, 2014). This paper presents the findings of a mixed method study that aimed to 1) document the formal and informal learning practices of university students in visual literacy; 2) explore the appreciation that university students make of the choices made by the trainers with regard to the presentation/production of course content; 3) analyze students' sense of competence in visual literacy. This article presents the results of the second objective. The results show that many students prefer a balance between traditional teaching practices and multimodal practices that use visual mode. On the other hand, the vast majority says that they learn more when the image is used as a support for presenting course content.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1708-7570			WOS:000438173800004		S	Yildiz, Cemalettin						Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		THE CONTRIBUTION OF GRAPHIC DESIGN EDUCATION TO LITERACY								10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2017)		ICERI Proceedings						2862	2865							2017	2017	The development of technology provides a prosperity in hardware and software capacities which is necessary to play an effective part of visuals into educational environment. Nowadays it is possible to encourage the participation of visual materials to processes with almost unlimited opportunities.Today's rich information world requires for more visual literacy skills increasingly. Instructors and education designers are dependent to visual elements to communicate. Even at a period which is very easy to access visual design tools, it may not be a natural talent for many people to use the visuals effectively. In such circumstances it is inescapable of education designers receiving help from graphic designers.Although "An image is worth a thousand words" is a true approach, knowing the factors which makes this image's effectiveness weak or strong is also important. Since there are so many rules of communication concepts at education world, computer terms world and design world, it is impossible not getting confused.In this paper with simplifying perception principles, reflections to graphic design will be evaluated. Connections between education and communication especially relationships with visual communication concept will be emphasized. Visual communication has definitely an important role while forming educational programs and transforming education institutions which trainers use as a base into educational models.Pedagogues have been complaining of teacher's being addicted to words as the communication tool since the earlier stages of education system. In fact, features of visual elements which make them easy to remember with revealing complicated situations, provide to take the place of words. It is a known fact that messages coded with visual elements are installed into student's memories and live there quite a while.					10th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)10th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 16-18, 2017NOV 16-18, 2017		Seville, SPAINSeville, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1095		978-84-697-6957-7	WOS:000429975302145		S	Sun, Fangmin						Hee, T; Liu, J		Meaning Constructed by Images in Cross-border E-business Websites - A Case Study in China from Social-semiotic Perspective								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION, MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS (ICEMSE 2017)		AEBMR-Advances in Economics Business and Management Research		49				180	183							2017	2017	In the new ear of cross-border e-commerce, businesses should raise awareness of globalization and pay more attention to multimodal communication. Image is a kind of social semiotic as important as language. Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwe's theory of Visual Grammar suggests that images can convey representational, interactive and compositional meaning, which provides concrete and feasible guidance for this research. The study also employs the comprehensive theoretical framework of multimodal discourse analysis proposed by Delu Zhang and attempts to build a basic framework to analyze meanings constructed by images in cross-border e-business websites, mainly on three levels: contextual layer, expressive layer and technical layer. A case in China was further studied under this framework. With findings drawn from the general data analysis based on the case, this paper aims to provide useful advice for website designs and enhance people's visual literacy.					2nd International Conference on Education, Management Science and Economics (ICEMSE)2nd International Conference on Education, Management Science and Economics (ICEMSE)	DEC 23-25, 2017DEC 23-25, 2017	Singapore Management Univ; Xian Jiaotong UnivSingapore Management Univ; Xian Jiaotong Univ	Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-5428		978-94-6252-435-4	WOS:000426885700044		S	Fitriani, Siti Sarah; Samad, Iskandar Abdul						Dirawan, GD		Visualization, Comprehension of Metacognitive Strategy, and The Importance Of An Evaluation Framework								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY (ICEST 2017)		Advances in Social Science Education and Humanities Research		149				165	167							2017	2017	Visualization metacognitive strategy, either internal or external, has been used for decades to help students comprehend a reading text. Their comprehension is usually evaluated using a reading comprehension test. Without this test, literacy teachers can actually evaluate students' comprehension by analyzing students' visual representations that they draw as a summary of a text they read. To do this, the teachers need a framework as the guideline to relate students' drawing to their comprehension. This paper proposes a framework necessary to evaluate students' comprehension of a reading text that they transform into a visual representation. The aspects in the framework are created based on the literature on visual literacy and genre-based literacy pedagogy. An example of the analysis is also provided in this paper.					2nd International Conference on Education, Science, and Technology (ICEST)2nd International Conference on Education, Science, and Technology (ICEST)	MAR 11-12, 2017MAR 11-12, 2017	Univ Negeri MakassarUniv Negeri Makassar	Univ Negeri Makassar, Pinisi Bldg, Makassar, INDONESIAUniv Negeri Makassar, Pinisi Bldg, Makassar, INDONESIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-5398		978-94-6252-403-3	WOS:000426687500055		J	JAEMANRYU; 이현경								A Study for developing Visual Literacy with Emoticon: Focused on Elementary Art Education			이모티콘 제작을 통한 시각적 문해력 신장 지도 방안					Art Education Research Review	미술교육논총			31	4			1	30							2017	2017	Due to the development of media, we live in a society filled with visual images. Naturally, students also can easily approach visual images.Today, students use emoticons actively to express their emotions in messenger. In changing visual culture, Art education should be able to raise children's critical eye and thoughts through educational teaching of various visual images. Therefore, this study let emoticon be dealt in art subject for students to actually make and use emoticon, ultimately improving the student's visual literacy. Emoticon expresses emotion visually, and to communicate with others with the visualized emoticon, one must use proper emoticon for one's emotion based on understanding of emoticon, which could lead to improvement of visual literacy. Thus, this study designed a study model and program to develop visual literacy through emoticons and this program was applied to 6th grade students in elementary school. As a result of developing the emoticon production class, the learner was able to gain enhancement of visual image recognition, visual image analysis, creative production through analogy, visual image utilization ability for communication and improvement of emotion understanding and expression.				매체의 발달로 인해 우리는 시각 이미지가 넘쳐나는 사회에 살고 있으며 스마트폰의 보급으로 인해 아이들도 이런 시각 이미지들을 손쉽게 접하고 있다. 특히 오늘날학생들은 메신저 상에서 감정표현을 하기위해 이모티콘이라는 시각 이미지를 적극적으로 소비하고 있다. 이렇게 변화하는 시각 문화 속에서 미술 교육은 아이들이 접하는다양한 시각 이미지들을 교육적인 주제로 다뤄 이런 이미지들에 대한 비평적인 안목과사고를 기를 수 있도록 해야 한다. 그렇기에 본 연구에서는 시각 문화 중 하나인 이모티콘을 학생들이 직접 제작하고 활용해보는 경험을 통해 시각적 문해력을 신장하고자한다. 이모티콘은 감정을 시각적으로 표현하고 있으며 이러한 이미지를 통해 상대방과소통을 하기 위해서는 이모티콘에 대한 이해를 기반으로 자신에게 적절한 이모티콘을활용해야하므로 시각적 문해력의 향상이 이루어질 수 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 이모티콘을 통해 시각적 문해력을 기르기 위한 수업모형을 구안하고 이 프로그램을 초등학교 6학년 학생에게 적용하였다. 이모티콘 제작 수업을 진행한 결과 학습자에게 시각적 이미지 인식, 시각적 이미지 분석, 유추를 통한 창의적 제작, 소통을 위한 시각적이미지 활용능력의 신장, 감정 이해와 표현의 향상의 효과를 얻게 되었다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-0440			KJD:ART002307154		J	Esparza-Morales, Ivonne; Tarango, Javier; Machin-Mastromatteo, Juan D.

The purpose of this article is to know if Mexican marketing students have the skills to develop reading comprehension competence based on the use of iconic text. A survey of basic, intermediate, and disciplinary competencies was applied to 72 students of this professional discipline at a public higher education institution in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. It was found that they do not have the necessary visual literacy skills given their academic and disciplinary level. Therefore, an educational intervention design is proposed (functional in the curricular or extracurricular modality), with the intention of offering an option that allows students to acquire the competences required for their professional training.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1132-1873	1988-2858		WOS:000419937900004		J	Morris, Julia E.; Lummis, Geoffrey W.; Lock, Graeme								Questioning art: Factors affecting students' cognitive engagement in responding								ISSUES IN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH				27	3			493	511							2017	2017	The Melbourne declaration on educational goals for young Australians (MCEETYA, 2008) cited confident and creative citizens as a key goal for Australian students. This goal aligns with global research on visual arts, specifically visual literacy. Being visually literate means decoding images, understanding the relationship between image and context, and recoding personal experiences into visual artworks. This learning is a core outcome of responding activities in secondary school visual arts. However, students will only develop visual literacy skills if they are engaged in their learning activities. Subsequently, this research sought to explore the cognitive engagement of students in the Year 11 visual arts course. The research utilised a mixed methods approach, which aimed to measure factors affecting student engagement. Quantitative measures of student engagement are rarely subject specific, and the creation of a quantitative visual arts diagnostic instrument gave information about students' engagement that could inform teacher instruction. Factors affecting students' engagement were determined through exploratory analysis of the diagnostic assessment instrument, with qualitative data used to explain the students' quantitative responses. Three key factors of cognitive engagement were determined: intrinsic motivation, metacognition and autonomy. Developing students' skills in these areas may improve their cognitive engagement in their visual arts education.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1837-6290			WOS:000418453300007		S	Tkhachenko, Evgeniy V.; Manko, Natalia N.; Shteinberg, Valerii E.

With this purpose it is changed and improved on cognitive principles of presenting knowledge: structures are created, elements are connected and curtailed at marking elements and relationships. In other words it is compressed for better understanding the knowledge and using it. Visualization occupies a deserving place in education. It improves the quality of professional, scientific and training activities. The research is held both in our country and abroad, where due to works, such as "mental maps", "maps of the mind" and "concept maps" a high level of visual literacy in education and production activity is provided. Remarkably, that a corresponding organizing-information resource is founded: Journal of Visual literacy, International Visual Literacy Association, Artstor Digital Library. Various trends of visualization are worked out within the above mentioned trends; one of them is logical cognitive modeling of knowledge, presented on a natural language. The peculiarity of approach is search of nature comfortable (socio-cultural) basis of graphic coordinating basic foundation for logical-cognitive models which provide their image-notion character.

The following article introduces this concept as it has been developed in recent work in visual culture studies and then offers a series of probes that attempt to assess the prominence of visual literacy in the ancient Near Eastern world. Though it is not possible to arrive at a precise rate of visual literacy, there is ample evidence to suggest that those who produced/commissioned art were highly concerned about questions regarding the readability of their materials and often privileged artistic motifs over epigraphic content in the design and implementation of certain mixed-media artifacts. These lines of evidence suggest that images functioned as a prominent vehicle of communication in the ancient world alongside, and sometimes in place of, text-based media. Research on visual literacy not only sheds new light on the ancient media contexts of the biblical world but also offers a more explicit rationale for how and why ancient images should be used in biblical interpretation today.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-2569	1568-5152		WOS:000408639500002		J	민경록								A Study on the Visual Literacy for Picture Book Reviews			그림책 서평의 시각적 문식성에 관한 연구					Journal of the Korean Library and Information Science Society	한국문헌정보학회지			51	3			83	108		10.4275/KSLIS.2017.51.3.083					2017	2017	As a public institution, it is the duty and responsibility of a library to provide readers with information about books. To provide such information to readers, a librarian should have the ability to provide satisfactory consultation and advice. As interest in picture books grows, there is an increasing need for libraries and librarians to produce and release picture book reviews on a regular basis to inform readers of what makes a good picture book, and which among similar books should they choose. Other than summarizing the content of a picture book, a good picture book review should also provide additional information that will help readers understand the reviewed book such as the literary symbolism of a book’s visual texts. To this end, a librarian is required to develop visual literacy, which would enable him/her to read into the deeper meaning of the images imbued with the writer’s ideas and philosophy. In light of the above discussion, this study compares and analyzes two picture book versions of the story Little Red Riding Hood, with the purpose of helping librarians understand the visual texts that they need to refer to when writing picture book reviews.				도서관은 독자에게 독서정보를 제공하여야 할 의무와 책임이 있는 대표적 기관이며, 사서는 독자에게 도서에 관한 정보를 제공하기 위하여 아낌없는 상담과 조언을 할 수 있어야 한다. 독자들의 그림책에 관심이 높아지면서 도서관과 사서는 훌륭한 그림책은 어떤 것인지? 유사한 종류의 다양한 도서 중 어떤 것을 선택할 것인지? 등의 도서 선택과 독서에 도움을 줄 수 있는 그림책 서평을 정기적이고 지속적으로 작성․제공하여 독자들의 독서정보를 지원할 수 있어야 한다. 문학과 예술의 복합장르인 그림책 서평을 작성하기 위하여서는 내용소개는 물론 시각 텍스트에 관한 문학적 상징성 등의 해설적인 정보를 제공할 수 있어야 한다. 이를 위하여 사서는 작가의 사상과 철학을 이미지로 형상화한 심층적인 의미를 읽을 수 있는 시각적 문식성을 갖추어야 한다. 이에 옛 이야기 ｢빨간모자｣를 다룬 두 작가의 그림책을 비교․분석하여 그림책 서평 작성 시 참고하여야 할 시각적 텍스트에 관한 이해를 돕고자 하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-598X			KJD:ART002254641		J	Bowen, Tracey								Assessing visual literacy: a case study of developing a rubric for identifying and applying criteria to undergraduate student learning								TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION				22	6			705	719		10.1080/13562517.2017.1289507					2017	2017	Higher education has traditionally privileged language-based text as evidence of students' levels of critical thinking and literacy. Twenty-first century education at all levels however, has focused on multimodal literacies and how educators can engage students who are seeing the world through diverse representations and a myriad of forms. Many scholars maintain that we live in a visual culture where we are becoming increasingly proficient at reading images of all kinds. However, our criteria for assessing student learning and measures of assessment have not moved much beyond the traditional written texts outside art and design disciplines. While much has been written about the role of visual literacy, there is little research on assessing visual literacy competencies. This paper proposes a Visual Literacy Competency (VLC) rubric based on the Biggs and Collis (1982. Evaluating the Quality of Learning: The SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome). New York: Academic Press) SOLO taxonomy and describes applications for assessing assignments in two undergraduate communications courses with a focus on further developing and shaping student learning.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1356-2517	1470-1294		WOS:000402985500006		J	정혜연; 서현정								Understanding Visual Literacy through Cooperative Learning Method: Focused on 6th Graders of Elementary School			시각적 의사소통능력 증진을 위한 협동학습 방법 연구: 초등학교 6학년을 중심으로					Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			18	1			145	171							2017	2017	As an elementary school teacher, the researcher of this study has experienced that students who suffered from the emotional problems such as alienation or maladjustment in school cannot effectively within the current competitive learning environment. To solve this problem, the researcher studied how “Cooperative learning method” could enhance students’ visual literacy. In order to practice this learning method, this study justifies ‘Visual literacy’ as an ability to interpret the meaning of image or to express the idea by symbolic image. This study focused on the development of learning methods for improving visual literacy by considering the increase of nonverbal communication and the rise of visual literacy education.The reason why ‘cooperative learning’ is chosen among learning methods is that cooperative learning has a possibility of promoting students’ active learning and providing them opportunities to interact with other students. Visual literacy can be learned in the learning process through the actual experience to participate in the cooperative interaction and communication actions.The research question for cooperative learning method established in this study are as follows : First, how can be cooperative learning program for practicing visual literacy education? Second, what is the value of cooperative learning for visual literacy education in art education? Third, what is the effect of cooperative learning for visual literacy education in the learning experience for students? To figure out the research questions, definition, characteristic, effect of visual literacy and cooperative learning was observed. The cooperative project learning program was established on the basis of project and conversation-centered group appreciation learning theory. Through textbook analysis, the cooperative learning for visual literacy education curriculum was redesigned to include visual culture by considering of the strategy and process of ‘Co-op Co-op’ model. This research was conducted trough 12 classed in 31 on 6th graders at the elementary school located Suwon.As this learning project processed, students showed increasing in understanding the context and relevance of visual images and life. Also, it enhanced level of visual expression and critical abilities. In addition to, the students themselves chose the topics and the activities carried out through consultations. Last, students' attitude toward cooperative learning and friendship has become more positive.Through cooperative learning, this research found: First, it was a learner- centered education of higher learning motivation and participation. Second, it was possible to participate at communicative action in the process of learning by the actual experience. Third, it was effective in improving critical thinking for viewers and consumers education. Fourth, it was integrated learning method for students' holistic growth. Fifth, it is significant to extend the personal thought through interaction with others and could promote close relationships.However, there is the limitation in that the object and contents only focus on 6th graders, and only learning process based on ‘Co-op Co-op’ model. There is difficult for some students to carry out activities in appreciation education.Therefore, the cooperative learning for visual literacy education can be made possible if various methods of cooperative learning are used to develop appreciation education and apply variety of subjects throughout the entire grades.				이 논문은 학생들 상호 간의 소통 증대를 위한 제안으로서 시각적 의사소통능력 신장을 위한 미술과 협동학습 방법을 모색하고 교육적 가치와 학습 경험에의 영향력을 연구하였다. 소통능력은 협력적 상호작용을 통해 의사소통 행위에 참여하는 학습 과정 안에서 체득할 수 있으므로 학습자 간의 교류 빈도가 높은 협동학습을 적용하였으며, 프로젝트 학습법, 대화중심 그룹 감상법, ‘Co-op Co-op’모형의 학습 절차를 바탕으로 협동적 프로젝트 학습의 계획을 수립하고 본 연구를 실행하였다. 연구의 결과 학습자 중심의 교육 방법으로 학습 동기와 참여도가 높았고, 실제적인 체험을 통한 의사소통의 실천이 가능하였으며, 능동적인 감상자 및 소비자를 위한 교육 방법으로 고급 사고력 및 비판적 해독력 향상에 효과적이었다. 또, 다학문적이자 통합적인 접근으로 학생들의 전인적인 성장에 도움이 되었으며, 타인과의 상호작용을 통해 인간관계의 긴밀함을 증진시킬 수 있었다는데 의의가 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART002196064		J	Dries, Daniel R.; Dean, Diane M.; Listenberger, Laura L.; Novak, Walter R.

Craig, Paul/0000-0002-2085-7816			An expanded framework for biomolecular visualization in the classroom: Learning goals and competencies								BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION				45	1			69	75		10.1002/bmb.20991					JAN-FEB 2017	2017	A thorough understanding of the molecular biosciences requires the ability to visualize and manipulate molecules in order to interpret results or to generate hypotheses. While many instructors in biochemistry and molecular biology use visual representations, few indicate that they explicitly teach visual literacy. One reason is the need for a list of core content and competencies to guide a more deliberate instruction in visual literacy. We offer here the second stage in the development of one such resource for biomolecular three-dimensional visual literacy. We present this work with the goal of building a community for online resource development and use. In the first stage, overarching themes were identified and submitted to the biosciences community for comment: atomic geometry; alternate renderings; construction/annotation; het group recognition; molecular dynamics; molecular interactions; monomer recognition; symmetry/asymmetry recognition; structure-function relationships; structural model skepticism; and topology and connectivity. Herein, the overarching themes have been expanded to include a 12th theme (macromolecular assemblies), 27 learning goals, and more than 200 corresponding objectives, many of which cut across multiple overarching themes. The learning goals and objectives offered here provide educators with a framework on which to map the use of molecular visualization in their classrooms. In addition, the framework may also be used by biochemistry and molecular biology educators to identify gaps in coverage and drive the creation of new activities to improve visual literacy. This work represents the first attempt, to our knowledge, to catalog a comprehensive list of explicit learning goals and objectives in visual literacy.

The corpus consists of eighteen texts written by students studying Spanish, and the texts were analyzed in the light of theoretical principles of multimodality and visual literacy theory proposed by Kress and Van Leeuwen (1996, 2006) regarding to metafunctions and image analysis, as set forth in The Grammar of Visual Design. In this regard, we intend to show how the production of texts may reveal signs of students' visual literacy in the contexts of teaching and learning in Spanish language classes.		Resumo: Este trabalho tem, por objetivo, analisar a multimodalidade e o letramento visual de alunos do curso de Espanhol do Núcleo de Línguas da Universidade Estadual do Ceará (UECE), ao ressignificarem um texto multimodal selecionado para a compreensão em produções escritas. O corpus coletado consiste de 18 (dezoito) textos escritos por alunos de língua espanhola e foi analisado à luz dos pressupostos teóricos da multimodalidade e do letramento visual de Kress e van Leeuwen (1996, 2006), no que diz respeito às metafunções e à análise da imagem, segundo a Gramática do Design Visual. Nesse sentido, almejamos mostrar como a produção dos textos pode revelar indícios de letramento visual dos alunos no contexto de ensino e aprendizagem nas aulas de Língua Espanhola.							0	0	0	0	0	0			1984-6398			SCIELO:S1984-63982016000400575		J	Jung, Sandro					Jung, Sandro/0000-0002-2241-2319			The Other Pamela: Readership and the Illustrated Chapbook Abridgement								JOURNAL FOR EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES				39	4			513	531		10.1111/1754-0208.12416					DEC 2016	2016	This article investigates questions of readership, pricing and visual literacy by relating eighteenth-century illustrated chapbook abridgements of Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) to the author's 1742 edition, featuring illustrations by Hubert-Francois Gravelot and Francis Hayman. It focuses on the affordability of chapbook abridgements and the straightforward readability of their illustrations, which would have been accessible to many readers. While few readers would have had access, financially, to the Gravelot-Hayman de luxe edition, Pamela chapbooks reached larger groups of readers and shaped the text's popular reception.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-0194	1754-0208		WOS:000388624000003		J	Fritze, Yvonne; Haugsbakk, Geir; Nordkvelle, Yngve								Visual 'Bildung' between Iconoclasm and Idolatry								NORDICOM REVIEW				37	2			17	31		10.1515/nor-2016-0015					NOV 14 2016	2016	The point of departure for this article is 'the visual turn', the proclaimed need for specific competencies, and furthermore the lack of clarity in the concepts and the lack of research that accompany the use of images. Terms like 'visual literacy' and "visual competence' are compared with a concept of visual 'Bildung'. 'Bildung' is presented as a concept that clearly goes beyond qualifications and a dominant market-oriented comprehension of competence. In its origin, 'Bildung' has obvious references to 'image', and it may also offer interesting new perspectives in the battle between words and images that has taken place throughout history and is a background to today's situation. 'Bildung' opens up an interesting path between iconoclasm and idolatry. The article proclaims an urgent need for a visual and reflective 'Bildung', because images are closely related to the world in which we live today.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1403-1108	2001-5119		WOS:000393115900002		J	Cappello, Marva; Walker, Nancy T.

The term visual literacy was introduced in the 1960s to describe an active and critical mode of reading images that was perceived as necessary amid a proliferation of new technologies for making and disseminating pictures. Yet the phenomenon of the ubiquitous technologically mediated image was as persistent in Crane's time as it is today, and Crane's censure of image-making under industrial capitalism shares similar concerns with contemporary efforts to promote visual literacy. In his early toy books published by George Routledge & Sons between 1865 and 1876, Crane focused primarily on creating beautiful illustrations with the purpose of cultivating an appreciation for beauty in readers to help them resist the effects of industrial capitalism. In his later books, particularly those that Crane wrote and illustrated himself between 1875 and the turn of the century (such as Slateandpencil-Vania, Little Queen Anne and Her Majesty's Letters, and Pothooks & Perseverance), these lessons in Aesthetic values are joined by instruction in visual literacy.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0266-6286	1943-2178		WOS:000388745600001		J	Meyer, Evelyn; Forester, Lee								Implementing Student-Produced Video Projects in Language Courses: Guidelines and Lessons Learned								UNTERRICHTSPRAXIS-TEACHING GERMAN				48	2			192	210		10.1111/tger.10195					FAL 2016	2016	Student-produced videos increasingly play a role in second language classrooms, driven in part by the perceived need to train students in new media production, the ubiquity of videos for self expression (YouTube), and current moves towards visual literacy and project-based learning and assessments. While consumption of video material is certainly on the rise, there is still a lack of practical materials for language teachers to train themselves and their students in fundamental skills needed for good video creation. This two-part article outlines key reasons and skills needed to create second language video projects tied into the language classroom, leveraging best practices in a way that does not overwhelm students and teachers with too much information. The first part surveys important aspects of good video production and is intended to be used as a checklist for instructors and students wishing to implement student-produced video projects in their language courses. The second half of the article is a case study of implementing student-produced videos for a culture project in a third-semester German course at an American university, and presents several suggestions and lessons learned.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0042-062X	1756-1221		WOS:000381313900003		J	Cheung, Chi-Kim; Jhaveri, Aditi Dubey								Developing students' critical thinking skills through visual literacy in the New Secondary School Curriculum in Hong Kong								ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION				36	3			379	389		10.1080/02188791.2014.959470					SEP 2016	2016	This paper argues that the planned introduction of visual literacy into the New Secondary School Curriculum can play a crucial role in enabling students to think critically and creatively in Hong Kong's highly visual landscape. As Hong Kong's educational system remains entrenched in long-established and conventional pedagogies, the primacy given to the written word is in sharp contrast with the pragmatic roles that visual images play in students' day-to-day life. Hong Kong is well-known for its extremely high level of Internet / broadband penetration and media saturation, yet visual literacy is still in a state of infancy in Hong Kong. Therefore, from a curricular standpoint, as Hong Kong society relies to a greater degree than ever before on visual communication strategies, it is vital that visual literacy be integrated as part of the new curriculum under the current educational reforms. As contemporary Hong Kong culture becomes increasingly dependent on the visual environment, developing visual literacy to enhance students' learning can be an important step in the future towards a more successful implementation and development of the New Secondary School Curriculum.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0218-8791	1742-6855		WOS:000377932100005		J	Damaskinidis, George								The Visual Aspect of Translation Training in Multimodal Texts								META				61	2			299	319		10.7202/1037761ar					AUG 2016	2016	This paper explores the wider issue of translation training in multimodal contexts. The multimodal text represents a complex semiotic canvas on which the various systems of signification (verbal, images, colour, layout, etc.) interact in complex ways to produce a coherent meaning. Such interactions affect translation students' understanding of multimodal texts and as such their training must also be visually-oriented in order to improve their translation efficiency when dealing with these texts. The paper is primarily (though not exclusively) concerned with the print multimodal text, and examines how the various aspects of the visual semiotic elements affect the teaching of its translation into another language. One such aspect is the new challenges that have been imposed by the visual on the field of translation studies. A second aspect is the visual implications for translation trainers and students. A third aspect is the wider multimodal context in which they have been found and involves the necessary multimodal approach to translation training, the development of a relevant awareness of multimodal texts and a number of other issues such as students' creativity and the role of the subject specialist in the translation classroom. Finally, suggestions are made for further development of relevant teaching areas that are driven by the visual aspect of the multimodal text.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-0452			WOS:000399191300005		J	Nunes, Tiago Alves; Tiba Radis Baptista, Livia Marcia								A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS: THE READING APPROACHES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR VISUAL LITERACY								DIALOGO DAS LETRAS				5	2			138	160							JUL-DEC 2016	2016	The image becomes a constituent part of various genres, integrating the vast discursive fields present in the social sphere of human communication and interaction. Thus, this research aims at diagnosing reading approaches present in Portuguese language teaching in the educational context and its implications for the visual literacy. To do so we have investigated the practice of a Portuguese language teacher in a public school, describing and interpreting the teacher-material relationship, and how the material used allow or not the promotion visual literacy. This work, moreover, is a part of a research developed in Nunes (2016), whose methological point of view is a qualitative-interpretative one and diagnostic based; and, a field study. As theoretical foundation, we have based on this study, on what is regard to visual literacy (ELKINS, 2009), in the theoretical and analytical assumptions of the Grammar of Visual Design (KRESS; VAN LEEUWEN, 2006) and visual Semantics (BAMFORD, 2003); and in what is concerned to reading approaches, in the studies of Cassany (2006), as well as in the studies about critical literacy (BAPTISTA, 2010, 2012, 2014). After the analysis, it is possible to say that the concept of reading established in the classroom is primarily psycholinguistic and linguistic. Moreover, the treatment given to the image is in general of an accessorial nature in the composition of the multimodal text. Therefore, the development of visual literacy, from a sociocultural perspective, is incipient in the teaching of native and foreign languages in the context investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2316-1795			WOS:000393478800010		J	McGahan, William; Ernst, Hardy; Dyson, Laurel Evelyn								Individual Learning Strategies and Choice in Student-Generated Multimedia								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE AND BLENDED LEARNING				8	3	SI		1	18		10.4018/IJMBL.2016070101					JUL-SEP 2016	2016	There has been an increasing focus on student-generated multimedia assessment as a way of introducing the benefits of both visual literacy and peer-mediated learning into university courses. One such assessment was offered to first-year health science students but, contrary to expectations, led to poorer performance in their end-of-semester examinations. Following an analysis, the assignment was redesigned to offer students a choice of either a group-based animation task or an individual written task. Results showed improved performance on the assignment when students were offered a choice of assignments over when they were offered only the multimedia assignment. Student feedback indicated that students adopt deliberate individual learning strategies when offered choices in assessment. The study suggests that assumptions regarding the superiority of student-generated multimedia over more traditional assessments are not always correct, but that students' agency and individual preferences need to be recognized.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1941-8647	1941-8655		WOS:000384549300002		J	Beaudoin, Joan E.

Through a series of three assignments, students were asked to provide descriptive information for a set of historical photographs and record reflections on their experiences via blog posts. The three separate versions of the image descriptions submitted by the students were analyzed to discern changes using descriptive statistics, and their blog posts were examined to identify recurrent themes using the constant comparative method. Findings associated with the image descriptions indicate that students' skill in describing the photographs show a modest increase across the three versions. Analysis of the blog postings revealed an overarching theme of frustration associated with the experience of developing image descriptions among the students. The underlying reasons for their frustrations are examined, and suggestions are provided for further increasing students' abilities to describe images.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0010-0870	2150-6701		WOS:000377528200008		J	Barger, Bradley								Teaching Students to See: Visual Learning Instruction for Two Different Undergraduate Anatomy Courses								FASEB JOURNAL				30			570.10								1	APR 2016	2016						Experimental Biology MeetingExperimental Biology Meeting	APR 02-06, 2016APR 02-06, 2016	Amer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt TherapeutAmer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0892-6638	1530-6860		WOS:000406444004248		J	Barger, Bradley								Teaching Students to See: Visual Learning Instruction for Two Different Undergraduate Anatomy Courses								FASEB JOURNAL				30			570.10								1	APR 2016	2016						Experimental Biology MeetingExperimental Biology Meeting	APR 02-06, 2016APR 02-06, 2016	Amer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt TherapeutAmer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0892-6638	1530-6860		WOS:000406444001008		J	Barger, Bradley								Teaching Students to See: Visual Learning Instruction for Two Different Undergraduate Anatomy Courses								FASEB JOURNAL				30			570.10								1	APR 2016	2016						Experimental Biology MeetingExperimental Biology Meeting	APR 02-06, 2016APR 02-06, 2016	Amer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt TherapeutAmer Assoc Anatomists; Amer Physiol Soc; Amer Soc Biochem & Mol Biol; Amer Soc Investigat Pathol; Amer Soc Nutr; Amer Soc Pharmacol & Expt Therapeut	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0892-6638	1530-6860		WOS:000406444000462		J	Shaw, Debora; Wagelie, Jennifer								Studying artworks and their digital copies: Valuing the artist's aura								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION THROUGH ART				12	1			57	69		10.1386/eta.12.1.57_1					MAR 2016	2016	Digital images extend access to works of art but little is known about of the benefits and limitations of digital copies for instruction. Students in a Museum Studies class viewed either the digital copy or original of two works of art.

Students had difficulty assessing materials and media with both original works and copies. The participants had similar insights and also encountered problems, regardless of whether the work of art was two-or three-dimensional. In describing the advantages of original works, the students also noted the power of the original's aura. Perceived strengths of the digital images included the ability to do research away from the museum (saving travel and time) and to manipulate the images.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1743-5234	2040-090X		WOS:000376525000005		J	Hutchison, Amy; Nadolny, Larysa; Estapa, Anne					Hutchison, Amy/0000-0003-1776-4552			Using Coding Apps to Support Literacy Instruction and Develop Coding Literacy								READING TEACHER				69	5			493	503		10.1002/trtr.1440					MAR-APR 2016	2016	In this article the authors present the concept of Coding Literacy and describe the ways in which coding apps can support the development of Coding Literacy and disciplinary and digital literacy skills.

As a need, it inquires into contrast ideas for motion. As a resource, it introduces visual examples of contrast, to highlight a specific visual principle. Contrast is a high-level principle creating both differences and unity between things by their relationships based on different assets and values. Visual contrast in stable images is achieved by the properties such as size, color, shape, position, texture and meaning etc. Visual contrast in motion images include frequency, trajectory, regularity, density and sequence. The significance of this research is to encourage the viewer to utilize contrast properties in stable and motion images to achieve continuity of their visual literacy when confronted with dissimilar visual designs.The process of the examination is: 1) Finding the best examples of contrast, 2) Accessing the examples to identify good contrasts, 3) Translating and interpreting the results into possible motion behaviors, 4) Inferring detailed motion behavioral words considering the properties of motion interval, speed, direction, pause and duration, etc., 5) Observing existing movie clips as analogies related to the motion behavioral words just inferred, and 6) Storyboarding for execution.The research takes a twofold approach: 1) Seeing as thinking (McKim, 1972) and as infinite seeking (Arnhiem, 1967), this research examines contrasts in motion as case studies in which the principle was inferred and generated by the insightful assessments of contrasts from stable artifacts, and 2) The research systematizes the process and method as "modeling of concept formation and rule induction" (Klahr & Simon, 1999) in relation to emerging knowledge development.					4th International Conference on Illustration and Animation (CONFIA)4th International Conference on Illustration and Animation (CONFIA)	JUN 10-12, 2016JUN 10-12, 2016		Barcelos, PORTUGALBarcelos, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-989-99465-6-9	WOS:000406379800028		B	Carpe, Inma; Garcia Rams, Susana			IPCA					Bringing Life to Illustration and Illustrating the World in Movement through Visual Literacy								4TH CONFERENCIA INTERNACIONAL EM ILUSTRACAO E ANIMACAO (CONFIA 2016)								505	513							2016	2016	If a picture is worth a thousand words" as Arthur Brisbane said, journalist of the New York Times in 1911 Fig. 1 How many words would equal the hundreds of frames containing in an animation? In this equation as any other, illustration and animation are complex visual expressions, full of shapes considered as symbols, characters of stories, real or fantasies which have strong links that increasingly intermingle thanks to the new technologies and applications that the transmedia world allows. Through visual literacy, either as still images or in movement, we learn to see, to feel and re-think our reality by playing with images, full of emotions. These ones are extremely relevant in the learning process and interpretation of experiences which produce our thoughts and feelings. Emotions affect our decision making, problem solving and focus attention, features which we work on during the creative process of an animated movie or making illustrations. We present animation, including illustration as part of the process, as a social emotional learning tool and media to enhance wellbeing and work neuroplasticity; by means working on aspects from cognitive neuroscience, such as attention, transportation or emotional simulation.There are numerous scientists such as Richard Davidson, Paul Ekman or Dan Siegel, who study the effects of our emotions in our behavior and brain functions; unfortunately there are almost no existing references regarding how the creative process of images or animated movies help our emotional brain to develop and learn to perceive or re-create data. The closest attempts are the studies from professors Uri Hasson, Paul Zack or Jeff Zacks, who acknowledge the impact of storytelling and live action movies on our brains and behaviors.Thanks to the emerging CrossMedia, Transmedia and Multiplatform; together with books, video games and digital applications; we can easily combine illustration and animation, learning more about their common aspects and differences. Under this perspective it doesn't seem so different illustrating the animated world, as animating the world that we try to illustrate.					4th International Conference on Illustration and Animation (CONFIA)4th International Conference on Illustration and Animation (CONFIA)	JUN 10-12, 2016JUN 10-12, 2016		Barcelos, PORTUGALBarcelos, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-989-99465-6-9	WOS:000406379800047		S	Fojtikova, K.

To read pictures is more than to read and write text, this is the "reading of the world of pictures". The Kaiser Family Foundation Study implies young people devote still greater attention to the pictures in the new media (Internet and social networks). While this was six hours and twenty-one minutes a day in average in 2009, it is seven hours and thirty-eight minutes a day in 2013. The numerical data say there has been a significant shift for 4 years and young people pay greater attention to pictorial information, they devote more of their time to them, by one hour and seventeen minutes. We may state that the use of new media has been intensified for recent 10 years, thus also time capacity devoted to media by young people has been increased too, save one exception the interest in reading has decreased, yet it still consider it to be the basic, non-excludable literacy. Saying it in more unambiguously, text reading gets to the background and the first place is attained by reading, or perception of pictures in digital media.In the article we present a theoretical model of visual literacy and develop new personnel competencies of children for the 21st century, such as visual perception, visual thinking, visual language and learning visual literacy.					3rd International Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities (SOCIOINT)3rd International Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities (SOCIOINT)	MAY 23-25, 2016MAY 23-25, 2016		Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-605-64453-7-8	WOS:000400168100090		B	Supsakova, Bozena						Uslu, F		VISUAL LITERACY AND DOMINANCE OF THE PICTORIAL WORLD								SOCIOINT16: 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES								743	752							2016	2016	The dominance of the pictorial world forms the beginning of the effect of new visual civilisation in the 21st century.

Another example of digitisation and mass communication is web page Pinterest allowing the users to create thematic sets of pictures or photos free of charge. Of course, the contemporary visual expression may be disputable as long as its functionality is concerned. Many times, we are the witnesses of the origin of the world of "hyper-reality" or virtual reality where experience, real pictures or products are replaced with the virtual ones.

Pilot and feasibility studies				2				46	46							2016	2016	BACKGROUND: Visualisation techniques are used in a range of healthcare interventions. However, these frequently lack a coherent rationale or clear theoretical basis. This lack of definition and explicit targeting of the underlying mechanisms may impede the success of and evaluation of the intervention. We describe the theoretical development, deployment, and pilot evaluation, of a complex visually mediated behavioural intervention. The exemplar intervention focused on increasing physical activity among young people with asthma.We employed an explicit five-stage development model, which was actively supported by a consultative user group. The developmental stages involved establishing the theoretical basis, establishing a narrative structure, visual rendering, checking interpretation, and pilot testing. We conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups during early development and checking, followed by an online experiment for pilot testing. A total of 91 individuals, including young people with asthma, parents, teachers, and health professionals, were involved in development and testing.RESULTS: Our final intervention consisted of two components: (1) an interactive 3D computer animation to create intentions and (2) an action plan and volitional help sheet to promote the translation of intentions to behaviour. Theory was mediated throughout by visual and audio forms. The intervention was regarded as highly acceptable, engaging, and meaningful by all stakeholders. The perceived impact on asthma understanding and intentions was reported positively, with most individuals saying that the 3D computer animation had either clarified a range of issues or made them more real. Our five-stage model underpinned by extensive consultation worked well and is presented as a framework to support explicit decision-making for others developing theory informed visually mediated interventions.CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the ability to develop theory-based visually mediated behavioural interventions. However, attention needs to be paid to the potential ambiguity associated with images and thus the concept of visual literacy among patients. Our revised model may be helpful as a guide to aid development, acceptability, and ultimately effectiveness.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2055-5784			MEDLINE:27965863	27965863	J	심향분								Exploring the Cultural Reading Process in Korean Picture Books for Multicultural Children			다문화 가정 유아들의 한국 그림책의 문화적 읽기 과정 탐구					Journal of Children＇s Literature and Education	어린이문학교육연구			17	4			99	124							2016	2016	This study explored what cultural content was contained in the Korean picturebooks and how multicultural children come to recognize their culture through reading Korean picture books. For this, this study collected and analyzed cultural content in Korean picture books and conducted participant observations and videotaped children’s reactions while children participated in Korean picture book reading activities within a small group at A-child care center. The findings reveal that children of multicultural families came to recognize culture as a bicultural experience, getting information needed to fill in the gap, and getting visual culture needed to facilitate visual literacy. Within this process, this study found the appearance of an individual communicative and emotional context wherein they receive attention from their story. These findings provide educators with a rationale for using Korean picture books to help build cultural images in children from multicultural familial.				본 연구의 목적은 한국 그림책 읽기과정 속에서 다문화 가정 유아들이 드러내는 반응에 대한 문화적 의미를 탐구하는데 있다. 이를 위하여 연구자는 A어린이집에서 다문화 가정 유아들이 한국 그림책 읽기를 진행하는 동안 참여관찰을 실시하고 읽기 과정의 맥락적 이해를 돕기 위하여 비디오 녹화하였다. 다문화가정 유아들은 외국인 어머니가 양육한다는 특수한 맥락에 놓여 있는 만큼 이중문화가 충돌되는 경험적으로의 문화, 공백이 엿보이는 정보로서의 문화, 도상적 의미 해독이 요구되는 시각 문화로서 문화 내용에 대한 반응 특성을 보였다. 그리고 그림책 읽기 과정은 유아들이 문화를 공유할 수 있는 공간으로서 보다 온전하게 수용되고 자신의 이야기를 들여다볼 수 있는 맥락적 기회가 필요하다는 의미를 드러내었다. 이러한 결과는 다문화 가정 유아들이 처한 삶의 문화적 특성을 돌아봄으로써 일반유아들과 비교적인 관점에서 문제점만을 인식하기보다 다문화가정 유아들의 문화 이미지 형성을 돕기 위한 그림책의 활용 방안 모색을 위한 기초자료를 제공할 수 있을 것으로 보인다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-3277			KJD:ART002180656		J	Park, Gun-Kyu; 김원석								An Examination on the Concept of Visual Literacy as a Basis for Convergence Education Programme			융복합교육 프로그램을 위한 기반으로서시각적 문해력(Visual Literacy) 개념 검토					Journal of Digital Convergence	디지털융복합연구			14	12			397	403		10.14400/JDC.2016.14.12.397					2016	2016	This research reviews the concept of Visual Literacy which is the critical base for performing convergence-style educational program of fine arts. The Visual Literacy means the ability to understand and properly deal with the visual information given to the agent such as the literacy to the written language. It is beyond doubt that the necessity of the Visual Literacy is raised because there is different visual information through new media for the entire life of young generation. Therefore, the Visual Literacy is the base for performing convergence-style education when it comes to performing convergence-style educational programs. It covers the communication abilities to utilize new media and exchange visual information one another.				본 연구는 미술교과를 중심으로 하는 융복합 교육 프로그램을 수행함에 있어 중요한 기반이 되는 시각적 문해력(Visual Literacy)의 개념을 검토한다. 시각적 문해력은 문자에 대한 문해력이 그러하듯이 주체에게 시각적으로 주어지는 정보를 이해하고 적절하게 다룰 수 있는 능력을 의미한다. 청소년층의 생활전반에서 뉴미디어를 통해 접하는 시각정보가 많고 다양한 만큼 시각적 문해력의 필요성이 대두되는 것은 당연하다. 따라서 뉴미디어를 적극 활용하는 융합교육 프로그램의 수행에서 시각적 문해력은 프로그램의 수행을 위한 기반이 된다. 여기에는 뉴미디어를 사용하여 시각정보를 교환하며 서로 소통하는 능력도 포함된다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-1916			KJD:ART002185881		J	Gilmore, Gwen; Thi My Dung Truong; Reilly, Michelle					Gilmore, Gwen/0000-0001-7793-2867			Vietnamese textual methodologies: a comparison of Australian with Swedish and New Zealand early childhood visual literacy contexts								EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CARE				186	11			1802	1820		10.1080/03004430.2015.1134520					2016	2016	For preservice teachers in early childhood education, having a rich exposure to multiple forms of literacy in diverse communities is an essential dimension of their teacher education. In this study, 10 Australian preservice early childhood education students, in the first year of their course, visit two early childhood settings in a large city in Vietnam to make deeper connections between literacy and practice contexts. They photographed literacy events and explored them to deepen their understandings of literacy. This paper examines photographs selected by these student teachers drawing on a framework used by Swedish and New Zealand (NZ) students, which focused on identifying a range of literacy concepts. We found that the Australian students focused on themes, meaning making and visual images for illustrating literacy comparison more frequently than their NZ and Swedish counterparts. Thus, the Mellgreen and Margrain framework has merit for teacher educators in expanding literacies in intercultural contexts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-4430	1476-8275		WOS:000386334400008		J	Lopatovska, Irene; Hatoum, Sarah; Waterstraut, Saebra; Novak, Lisa; Sheer, Sara								Not just a pretty picture: visual literacy education through art for young children								JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION				72	6			1197	1227		10.1108/JD-02-2016-0017					2016	2016	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand young children's knowledge of visual literacy elements as well as their ability to comprehend newly introduced visual literacy concepts. The study also examined existing support for visual literacy programs from parents and educators.Design/methodology/approach - The study explored the knowledge of basic visual literacy elements of young children enrolled in two private schools in the New York City metropolitan area. The authors interviewed 17 children, aged four to six years old, about fine art paintings using a semi-structured interview format. Children's responses were qualitatively analyzed to determine their initial level of visual literacy and their ability to learn and retain the concepts of visual literacy after receiving basic instruction. The children's educators and parents completed online questionnaires that were quantitatively analyzed to determine their level of support for visual literacy programs.Findings - The findings show that young children exhibited extensive knowledge of simple visual literacy elements (color, shape, line), and limited understanding of more abstract elements (perspective and salience). Children's knowledge of visual elements improved after instruction. Parents and educators expressed support for incorporating visual literacy instruction in early childhood education.Research limitations/implications - The study relied on a sample of children and adults drawn from two private schools. The sample's demographics might have affected study findings. More studies are needed using a larger and more diverse sample.Practical implications - The study suggests that young children are ready to receive instruction on visual literacy elements using art images. Children reacted positively to the images and were engaged in the discussions about them, supporting the use of fine art paintings as an instrument to introduce visual literacy concepts to young children. Survey of children's parents and teachers indicated strong interest in, and support for such programs.Social implications - With the increase of visual information production and consumption, it is important to introduce visual literacy early in life. The study advances research in methods for developing visual literacy instruction for young children.Originality/value - There are no previously reported studies that have examined pre-kindergarten children's knowledge of basic visual literacy elements and reactions to visual literacy instruction.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-0418	1758-7379		WOS:000386148200010		J	Sarar Kuzu, Tulay								The Impact of a Semiotic Analysis Theory-Based Writing Activity on Students' Writing Skills								EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH					63			37	54		10.14689/ejer.2016.63.3					2016	2016	Problem Statement: In entering the world intellectually and affectively equipped, humans develop in a systemic way that encompasses both thought and art education and in which written, oral, and visual texts are important tools. In particular, visual literacy, which refers to the interpretation of elements other than written text, including images, symbols, shapes, and colors, has come into prominence through new learning approaches that emphasize the importance of using numerous stimuli. All texts convey a meaning and a message, which to comprehend requires textual analysis, the different theories and methods of which vary among various types of texts. As discussed in this article, the semiotic analysis theory provides tools for textual analysis concerning the dimensions of narrative discourse.Purpose: This study aimed to determine how a writing lecture activity based on semiotic analysis theory affects students' writing skills. To that end, cartoon caricatures were selected as visual texts for analysis.Method: This experimental research based on pre- and post-tests was conducted with a dependent group of 40 7th-grade students in a school within Turkey's Ministry of Education. Data collection involved having each student develop two texts for caricature analysis: one prior to an experiment based on the traditional approach, and the other after an experiment based on the semiotic method. The differences between scores received for each text by all students were analyzed.Findings: Results revealed that textual analysis based on the semiotic theory was more effective for the writing skills of students than the traditional writing method with respect to three areas of evaluation: understanding the subject, accessing the message, and multidimensional interpretation.Conclusion and Recommendations: The findings suggest that the proposed method of semiotic analysis is an alternative to traditional methods used in Turkish-language courses that can enhance the effectiveness of learning and positively affect students' creative-writing skills.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1302-597X			WOS:000384748100003		J	Zimmermann, Corinne; Huang, Jennifer T.; Buzney, Elizabeth A.

Refining the Eye: Art and Dermatology, a four session workshop, took place in the museum's galleries and utilized the Visual Thinking Strategies framework along with other visual training exercises. The week before the course commenced, participants took a one hour pre-test composed of the following: two medical images of dermatologic conditions, two art images, Communication Skills Attitudes Scale, and Budner's Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale. After completion of the course, participants took a one hour post-test composed of previously stated items. Results of these tests were compared to determine changes in observational skills, communication skills, and tolerance of ambiguity. A survey addressing their attitudes towards the course was also completed by the participants.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-8650	2051-6169		WOS:000376594100007		J	Koscak, Stephanie								The Royal Sign and Visual Literacy in Eighteenth-Century London								JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES				55	1			24	56		10.1017/jbr.2015.175					JAN 2016	2016	This article argues that the commercialization of monarchical culture is more complex than existing scholarship suggests. It explores the aesthetic dimensions of regal culture produced outside of the traditionally defined sphere of art and politics by focusing on the variety of royal images and symbols depicted on hanging signs in eighteenth-century London. Despite the overwhelming presence of kings and queens on signboards, few study these as a form of regal visual culture or seriously question the ways in which these everyday objects affected representations of royalty beyond asserting an unproblematic process of declension. Indeed, even in the Restoration and early eighteenth century, monarchical signs were the subject of criticism and debate. This article explains why this became the case, arguing that signs were criticized not because they were trivial commercial objects that cheapened royal charisma, but because they were overloaded with political meaning. They emblematized the failures of representation in the age of print and party politics by depicting the monarchy-the traditional center of representative stability-in ways that troubled interpretation and defied attempts to control the royal image. Nevertheless, regal images and objects circulating in urban spaces comprised a meaningful political-visual language that challenges largely accepted arguments about the aesthetic inadequacy and cultural unimportance of early eighteenth-century monarchy. Signs were part of an urban, graphic public sphere, used as objects of political debate, historical commemoration, and civic instruction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9371	1545-6986		WOS:000367720000002		B	Queiroz, Raquel Gularte; Ulbricht, Vania Ribas						Rivas, MC; Cechinel, C; Chacon, IA; Alfaro, AF		Art, Creativity and a Learning Object Proposal								2016 XI LATIN AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON LEARNING OBJECTS AND TECHNOLOGY (LACLO)								31	36							2016	2016	This article is the result of research that sought relationships between art and creativity.

While earlier reviews of mobile technology may have led to criticism of these devices as being largely for consumption, many current uses emphasize creativity and productivity, with diverse purposes ranging from blogging and social networking to near full-scale video editing, office productivity and language translation. These affordances are further made possible by the large-scale development of mobile applications (or apps). For the vast majority of mobile device users-now numbering in the billions-many of these learning experiences are informal and just-in-time, sometimes unplanned, unsanctioned by educational discourse and beyond the immediate locus of institutional control. As smart technologies become increasingly an extension of the personal, educators are faced with the question: how can we best facilitate and explicate the learning process and design relevant experiences that leverage the affordances of so many mobile devices? This paper explores how the effective use of apps enable the learning process to be visualized in ways that support meaningful and student-centered learning. The authors discuss recent developments in technology, mobile learning and multiliteracies, drawing on a range of case studies deploying mobile devices and using apps as part of learner-led inquiry processes to enable creativity, collaboration and critical thinking. Emerging from these case studies are real classroom examples, teacher-student reflections, scaffolds and working models that all speak to the importance of using apps to visualize learning and support learners at each stage of the learning process. Exploring the connections between mobile devices, media literacy and visual literacy, the paper also emphasizes the collaborative affordances of many current apps and the importance of multimodal forms of representation through gesture, voice, text, video and audio. Citing the common issues involved in deploying mobile devices in most education institutions, the authors argue the need for schools and education systems to move away from infrastructure-led developments towards more learner-led solutions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1479-4403			WOS:000376183500006		J	Aristizabal, Pilar; Lasarte, Gema; Tresserras, Alaitz								Playing with pictures: a practice of media literacy in Early Childhood Education								REVISTA DE INVESTIGACION EN EDUCACION				13	2			243	255							OCT 2015	2015	This paper reflects on the new challenges facing the teaching of image and media literacy in early childhood education.

The purpose of this study is to introduce the phototherapy technique as a method which will increase therapeutic communication in the process of psychological counseling and to present an example for training purposes based on the use of the technique.The study was conducted in the phenomenology design, one of the qualitative research patterns. The study group was comprised of nine senior students who have been in the department of psychological counseling and guidance. The data were collected with the structured interview technique using photography. As a result of the application, it was observed that the use of photography enabledthe initiation and deepening of communication among the group members. In respect to the meaning of the photos chosen, eight members of the study group have brought a photo with a positive meaning and one has brought a photo with a negative meaning. It was inspected that each participant clearly and thoroughly remembered the story of the photo he brought fort he study and expressed that they had the same feeling at the moment.

Professional development books covers contain visual representations of literacy practices, particularly the practices of reading comprehension and reading instruction. The multimodal representations of literacy practices have the potential to impact how literacy educators view, approach, and carry out the practice of teaching reading. Using a social semiotic perspective, the authors analyze 150 professional development book covers intended for classroom teachers. This multilevel, qualitative content analysis examines specific types of literacy practices represented on books and leads to the development of the Multimodal Ensemble Analytical Instrument (MEAI) as a way to guide analysis of representative cover images. Findings are examined in two ways: (1) across four specific literacy practices (reading aloud, independent reading, reading instruction, and reading activities), and (2) within each of the individual literacy practices.

We conclude that Tan's work ultimately acts as an accessible resource for educators striving to employ multiliteracies practices and bring multimodal texts into their classrooms.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000360769000012		J	Ruchikachorn, Puripant; Mueller, Klaus								Learning Visualizations by Analogy: Promoting Visual Literacy through Visualization Morphing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS				21	9			1028	1044		10.1109/TVCG.2015.2413786					SEP 2015	2015	We propose the concept of teaching (and learning) unfamiliar visualizations by analogy, that is, demonstrating an unfamiliar visualization method by linking it to another more familiar one, where the in-betweens are designed to bridge the gap of these two visualizations and explain the difference in a gradual manner. As opposed to a textual description, our morphing explains an unfamiliar visualization through purely visual means. We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples: data table and parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and hyperbox, linear chart and spiral chart, and hierarchical pie chart and treemap. The analogy is commutative i.e. any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A series of studies showed that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. The participants could understand the unfamiliar visualization methods in all of the four pairs either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with the transitions from the familiar counterpart. The four examples suggest how helpful visualization pairings be identified and they will hopefully inspire other visualization morphings and associated transition strategies to be identified.									13	1	0	0	0	13			1077-2626	1941-0506		WOS:000358916100004	26357285	J	Valdivino da Silva, Maria Zenaide; Araujo, Antonia Dilamar								Multimodality and teaching from the perspective of English language teachers in public schools								ANTARES-LETRAS E HUMANIDADES				7	14			313	335							JUL-DEC 2015	2015	With the changes that have happened in the various social spheres in communication, texts have been characterized more and more as multimodal. Taken this for granted, to the school is given the responsibility to develop necessary literacies in students to act in many different contexts of communication and human interaction. This study is associated to social semiotic and it is characterized as a descriptive and interpretive research. It aims to investigate conceptions of English language teachers on the use of multimodal texts in the classroom. We realized that the images are still seen as resources to increase the attractiveness of classes and to facilitate understanding about the verbal text, with translational function, without taking into account the critical or the visual literacy approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1984-4921			WOS:000366979600014		J	George-Hirons, Amy								Yokol Cab: Mayan Translation of European Astrological Texts and Images in the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua								ETHNOHISTORY				62	3			525	552		10.1215/00141801-2890221					JUL 2015	2015	When we consider questions of alphabetic, cultural, and visual literacy in colonial Mesoamerica, an analysis of the way in which the producers of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua appropriated European astronomical texts and images from medieval reportorios demonstrates much about how Mayan scribes and illustrators understood European astrology and the importance that the Maya placed on both visual representations and Spanish textuality. These excerpts served a didactic purpose of teaching European conceptions of astrology and astronomy to a Mayan audience via a deliberate textual and visual translation process.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0014-1801	1527-5477		WOS:000360238000007		J	Louie, Belinda; Sierschynski, Jarek								Enhancing English Learners' Language Development Using Wordless Picture Books								READING TEACHER				69	1			103	111		10.1002/trtr.1376					JUL-AUG 2015	2015	This article presents an approach to use wordless picture books to enhance the language development of English language learners. This approach is grounded in best practices to teach ELLs. The process starts with viewing and analyzing the visual images, engaging ELLs in discussion, and ending with students' self-authored texts. The wordless picture books contain all the literary elements and text structures that books with text have. Wordless picture books, without the language demands, invite ELLs to share the reading experience and to construct meaning from the viewing experience. Since wordless picture books vary in its complexity, booklist indicating level of complexity with annotations is provided for K-5 students. Classroom discussion and writing samples are also included to demonstrate the four stages of this instructional approach.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000356874600013		J	Pantaleo, Sylvia								Language, Literacy and Visual Texts								ENGLISH IN EDUCATION				49	2			113	129		10.1111/eie.12053					SUM 2015	2015	Explicit pedagogy that focuses on visual design and composition principles can affect students' responses to and understanding, interpretation and analysis of images, as well as the creation of their own visual representations. This article considers the why, the what, and the how of teaching various visual elements of art and design to students through the description of two classroom-based studies. Multimodality, social semiotics, visual literacy and sociocultural theory framed the studies described in this article. As well as explaining some of the activities that the students engaged in during the studies, this article features examples of students' written responses to various picturebooks and graphic novels. The students' text-based writing reveals their knowledge, appreciation and interpretation of various visual elements of art and design.

The author discusses the students' uses of these focal media through the concept of affordances, a concept that refers to the distinct possibilities and limitations of a particular mode or medium. Blogs afforded a means of responsive, written social interaction with other students about their learning, and the possibility of composing texts with embedded links to other webpages that had been explored on the topic. Digital video afforded distinctly visual means of representing their subject matter and the presentation of complex ideas through visual montage and juxtaposition of text and image. Teachers can use knowledge about these media affordances as they consider how these two media might be useful in their own classrooms and inquiry projects.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000351626000008		J	O'Byrne, W.

Historical buildings are an important component of historical study, and they serve as a type of nontraditional text that students can decode and use to construct meaning about multiple historical contexts. The skills used to understand and analyze historical buildings are in and of themselves important, but engaging them also builds critical deep comprehension skills as well. This paper presents a research-tested framework for historic building analysis that can be used to build disciplinary analytical skills in history, while meeting the challenges of the Common Core Standards, which require that students be able to deeply understand a variety of types of traditional and nontraditional texts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000350640200007		J	Wolsey, Thomas DeVere; Smetana, Linda; Grisham, Dana L.								Vocabulary Plus Technology An After-Reading Approach to Develop Deep Word Learning								READING TEACHER				68	6			449	458		10.1002/trtr.1331					MAR 2015	2015	Students who can use a term conversantly in academic environments know how to use it precisely in their writing and in their interactions with others; they can be said to deeply know, not just the word term in alphabetic or spoken forms, but the connections to ideas the term embodies. When students are intrigued by words and ideas, they want to dig more intensely. Traditionally, word learning tasks in schools do not mirror the way that words are learned beyond school walls. Vocabulary self-collection strategy plus (VSS+) is an instructional routine using multimodal and online tools to promote engaged word learning in an authentic way. Generative technologies, such as those employed in VSS+, use the affordances of technology to combine reading and writing skills with genuine inquiry for learning content within learning communities.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0034-0561	1936-2714		WOS:000350644800009		J	Van Duinen, Deborah Vriend; Schoon-Tanis, Kathryn								"Who are Our Mockingbirds?": Participatory Literacies in a Community-Wide Reading Program								JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY EDUCATION				11	1			127	136							SPR 2015	2015	Drawing on sociocultural perspectives of literacy, this Voices From the Field paper presents artifactual data collected during a community-wide reading program of To Kill a Mockingbird. During this program, over 400 high school students and community members participated in an art project in which they artistically responded to the question, "Who are the mockingbirds?" by reflecting on marginalized or oppressed people in their community. Findings suggest that there was significant variation in how participants artistically responded to the question prompt; there were differences in how participants drew on their own literacies to complete the project, how they visually communicated their ideas, and how they defined the community or audience for their work. These findings suggest that more attention to embodied literacies, visual and critical visual literacy practices, and place-based pedagogies, is needed in both school and out-of-school contexts. Throughout the article, we provide several images of the completed individual mockingbirds as well as an image of the final collaborative mockingbird project.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-9035			WOS:000379651700009		J	Hobson, Sarah R.; Vu, Julie F.

The authors present two major arguments: (1) teachers can help students analyze the processes that influence and shape their identities by adopting a proleptic framework; (2) ethnodrama, a dramatic and dialogic approach to interpreting texts, creates an opportunity for students to evaluate the social forces that shape identity construction as they situate and reflect on texts within multiple contexts. The authors delineate the ways in which teachers can use ethnodrama to help students revise their understandings of the personal and cultural implications of texts by situating these understandings in different configurations of place, space, and time.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000348862600008		J	Estrada, Fabiola Cristina Rodriguez; Davis, Lloyd Spencer								Improving Visual Communication of Science Through the Incorporation of Graphic Design Theories and Practices Into Science Communication								SCIENCE COMMUNICATION				37	1	SI		140	148		10.1177/1075547014562914					FEB 2015	2015	Visual culture is becoming an increasingly prominent part of our cultural identity in the 21st century. Consequently, images have become an important tool with which to communicate science. We identify two impediments to science communicators using visual elements effectively: (1) visual material is typically treated as an add-on instead of being an integrated part of the whole and (2) there is a lack of identifying target audiences and refining visual elements for them specifically. We argue that science communicators can become more effective visual communicators if they incorporate elements of theory and practice from the discipline of design.									10	0	0	2	0	10			1075-5470	1552-8545		WOS:000348736300007		B	Garcia-Sanchez, Felicidad; Cruz-Benito, Juan; Theron, Roberto; Gomez-Isla, Jose				Cruz-Benito, Juan/C-5589-2014	Cruz-Benito, Juan/0000-0003-2045-8329; Theron, Roberto/0000-0001-6739-8875; Garcia-Sanchez, Felicidad/0000-0001-7397-3194	Alves, GR; Felgueiras, MC		Designing and building systems and tools to analyze visual communications on social networks								THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGICAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR ENHANCING MULTICULTURALITY, PROCEEDINGS TEEM'15								325	329		10.1145/2808580.2808629					2015	2015	This paper presents a work in progress project that implements a set of tools and systems to allow researchers performing qualitative and quantitative analysis about visual communication in social networks.

The usage of this visual signs and messages require in some way learning from the stakeholders involved in the communication or other information sources, and it has observed that visual communication users learn usually in a informal way and mostly by imitating the communication patterns used by influential people.

Delivery elements of visual literacy according to the stages of visual information, suggested by Dondis, are composed of 3 individual stages: 1)symbols to contain meanings, 2)representative media that perform a function of information, 3)the substructure that performs a visual function. This study arranged subtypes of the visual function and divided them into 6 elements. It also analyzed illustrations of the second and seventh moral textbooks, selected targeting textbooks, to find out how visual literacy functioned in expression according to the state, social and individual types. First, illustrations in the second textbook appeared as the symbols of: people and powerful men; freedom and oppression; children's ethical duty for their parents; the vertical relationship between students and teachers. After 2000, it appeared as the symbol of: the divided country between the South and the North of Korea; neighbors and parents; children's social relationship; personal and group responsibility. Second, as the representative medium that performed a function of information, illustrations in both second and seventh textbooks appeared as watercolors; after 2000, they appeared as the combination of pastel and watercolors, cartoon expression. Third, in the second illustration, Shapes that symbolized force, authority and high position were small in number and placed in the center; they were expressed by positive gestures and achromatic and blue colors. On the other hand, after 2000, the state was classified and expressed as the masculine characters and colors; in the social theme, shapes were highlighted by softened colors and simplified backgrounds. In the individual type before 90s, the vertical relationship showed traditional polite expression in contrast with expression of the Western-style appearance shown in clothes and buildings. Through this, shape and motion were remarkably changed in the type of the state. However, shape, size and motion were similar, and color was different in the type of society. In the type of individual, the expression was changed by highlighting personal shape, size and motion more than group's.				사회와 매체의 환경이 변화하고 시각적 이미지의 비판적 해석과 수용은 곧 창의적인 생산능력이라는 비주얼 리터러시의 관점으로 강조되기 시작하였다. 돈디스가 제시한 시각정보 단계에 따른 비주얼 리터러시 전달요소는 의미를 담기위한 상징, 정보의 기능을 수행하는 재현적 매체, 가장 중요한 시각적 기능을 수행하는 하부구조의 3 가지 개별적 단계로 이루어진다. 본 연구에서는 시각적 기능에 대한 유형들을 형상, 크기, 색채, 동세, 젠더, 공간 6 가지 요소로 분류하였다. 1990 년대를 전후로 2 차와 7 차의 도덕교과서 일러스트레이션을 선정하여 국가, 사회, 개인 유형별로 비주얼리터러시가 어떻게 표현적, 상징적 기능을 하였는지 분석하였다. 첫 번째, 시각 상징으로 2 차는 국민과 권력자, 자유와 억압, 부모와 자녀의 윤리적 도리, 학생과 선생님의 상하관계 등으로 나타났으며 7 차에서는 남북한의 분절된 국가, 이웃과 부모, 자녀의 사회적 관계, 개인과 집단 책임의 상징으로 나타났다. 두 번째 재현적 매체로 2 차에서는 수채화표현이 주로 나타났고 7 차에는 수채화, 혼합기법과 만화적 표현 등이 나타났다. 세 번째, 힘, 권력 관계를 상징하는 형상은 크고 중앙 구도에 위치하며 능동적 제스처, 무채색, 푸른톤 색채로 표현되었다. 반면 7 차에서 국가는 남성적 캐릭터로 표현되었으며 사회에서 색채는 부드러워지고 배경을 단순화하고 형상을 강조하였다. 2 차에서는 서구식 외형표현과 달리 상하관계의 전통적 표현으로 대비되어 나타났다. 이를 통하여 국가 유형은 형상, 동세 변화가 두드러지지만 사회는 형상, 크기, 동세가 유사하며 색채는 차이를 보였다. 개인 유형에서는 집단보다 개인의 형상과 크기, 동세를강조하는 표현으로 변화하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-8635			KJD:ART002027753		J	Ernst, Hardy; McGahan, William T.; Harrison, John								Questionable Benefit of Visual and Peer Mediated Learning on Overall Learning Outcomes of a First-Year Physiology Course								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE AND BLENDED LEARNING				7	1			25	40		10.4018/ijmbl.2015010103					JAN-MAR 2015	2015	This paper reports on attempts to incorporate creative visual literacy, by way of student owned technology, and sharing of student-generated multimedia amongst peers to enhance learning in a first year human physiology course(1).

This work is a frame of a doctorate research in Education, which establishes bonds among the Phenomenology of Perception, Multiple Literacies and the Teacher's Education. Based on the Phenomenology, the current study crosses the world experiences lived by this researcher and the other teachers of public schools in Natal-RN (Brazil) in a scenario of Teacher's Continuous Education in Arts. In that context, it is considered the circularity among description, reduction, interpretation, intentionality, comprehension and action. The defended thesis proposes that the time for the continuous education in Arts enhances a style of being a mediator of the visuality teacher as a sensitive experience of the body. The required opening for the world consists in a look happening in which reading attribute senses to the things, words, images, sounds and the touch: an experience which invites the teachers to act when affected by that one and it is constituted fully esthetical/ esthesiological.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1518-1634	1807-1600		WOS:000361544800021		S	Grenfell, Janette						Preuveneers, D		Blended Learning and the Flipped Classroom: The affordances of cloud based, located, and virtual world environments to support student learning								WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ENVIRONMENTS		Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments		19				333	344		10.3233/978-1-61499-530-2-333					2015	2015	In this paper the author reports on the introduction of the flipped classroom integrating located, online and virtual world learning environments to support the collaborative lived experiences of a group of students and the educator participating in a higher education undergraduate art unit, Navigating the Visual World.

The advantages brought to the educational process by utilizing modern means have been the subject of many researches, all agreeing to the idea that integrating new ways of education don't exclude the traditional ones, but the twining of the two. Therefore, this paper focuses on some activities that can be applied in Literature classes, based on Manga books. Thus, in accordance with the objectives of the high school Curriculum, teachers can guide students towards reading through graphic texts, and students can develop their critical thinking by working with the illustrated text. As an example, there will be used a comparison between Romeo and Juliet - the classic version of William Shakespeare and the Manga version by Sonia Leong. Thereby, alongside other competences acquired during Literature classes, students can also obtain visual literacy - essential for personal development in the contemporary world.					5th International Conference on LUMEN Transdisciplinarity and Communicative Action (LUMEN-TCA)5th International Conference on LUMEN Transdisciplinarity and Communicative Action (LUMEN-TCA)	NOV 21-22, 2014NOV 21-22, 2014		Targoviste, ROMANIATargoviste, ROMANIA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-88-7587-713-2	WOS:000360478000046		J	정경열								A Study of Literary Effect on Image Literacy Education :From the perspective of Peirce’s Semiology			영상 리터러시 교육(VIE)의 문학적 효과 연구: '퍼스 기호학'의 관점으로					Assoication of Image & Film Studies	영상예술연구			26				155	185							2015	2015	This thesis is a result of my research about the linguistic relationship between text and image, which is based on an educational product of the VIE(Videography In Education) program aimed at youths. At the times of needs in proper image-literacy education, especially at this video era, the result of VIE program through text and image shows semiologic and linguistic relationship and functions between the two of them. While literary message is generated from the combination of text and image, Peirce's 3 types of classification can be referred to – Icon, Index, and Symbol - which defines interrelation of text and image. Those 3 types are determined by mutual priority of text and image, and also can be applied to works of students.In the student’s images and poems, We can find very developed works from Iconic works which are directly linked to images to symbolic works which are searching for the metaphorical linking point beyond first signification even though images and poetic words look like that they don’t have anything in common.Developmental orientation that take advantage of this VIE activities can be presented with educational strategies. those are activation of indicator characteristic which is in the iconography of video images and moving symbolic characteristics to the realms of indication for the connection of images and poetic words.The Key points are how to continue the tensional beauty of metaphor maintaining appropriate iconography of photography and symbolism of poet. This advantage is why image literacy should back up education in VIE. This study finds out youths' linguistic creativity making best use of text and image, in semiotic consideration of works of students. Thus, it has meaning in terms of the aspect of visual literacy education.As a result, the images do not only contain the representation of reality in every life, but express specific information and semiotic implications. and images also enable us to have emotional and literary communication over the difference of text and languages. The VIE is an integrated media literacy education covering a healthy imagination and linguistic features of literary text in the image.				본 논문은 청소년을 대상으로 한 VIE 프로그램의 교육성과를 바탕으로 텍스트와 이미지와의 언어와 문학적 관계를 연구한 결과다. 디지털 영상 시대를 맞아 올바른 이미지 리터러시 교육이 필요한 시점에서 텍스트와 이미지를 활용한 VIE 프로그램의 결과는 양자간의 기호학과 문학적인 관계와 기능을 보여준다.텍스트와 이미지의 통합으로 메시지가 창출되는데 이 때 퍼스(Peirce)의 텍스트와 이미지의 상호 관계를 정의한 세 분류인 도상, 지표, 상징이 등장한다. 텍스트와 이미지의 상호간의 우선권에 따라 결정되는 이 3가지 종류의 분류는 학생들의 작품에도 적용될 수 있다.학생들의 영상 이미지와 연결된 시를 보면 이미지에 직설적으로 연결된 도상과 같은 작품에서부터 이미지와 시어가 전혀 동 떨어져 보이지만 1차 의미작용을 넘어 은유적 연결 접점을 찾아 상징으로 발전한 작품까지 볼 수 있었다. 이를 바탕으로 제시할 수 있는 영상활용교육(VIE)의 발전적 지향점은 영상 이미지의 도상성 속에 내재된 지표적 특성을 활성화시키고, 시어는 이미지와의 연결성을 위해 상징적 특성을 지표적 영역으로 이동시키는 교육적 전략이다.여기서 핵심 사항은 사진의 도상성과 시의 상징성을 어떻게 적절히 유지하면서 은유적 긴장미를 지속시켜 나가느냐에 있다. 이점이 VIE 교육에서 이미지 리터러시가 뒷받침되어야 하는 이유다. 본 연구는 학생들의 작품을 기호학적으로 고찰함으로써 텍스트와 이미지를 활용한 청소년들의 언어적 창의성에 대해 알아보고 이를 이미지 리터러시 측면에서 의미를 전환시키려 한다.결과적으로 이미지는 일상의 실제 대상물을 담아내는 것에만 그치지 않고 기호학적으로 구체적 내용과 함축된 의미를 가진 표현물이며 문자와 언어가 가지는 차이를 초월해 감성적이고 문학적인 커뮤니케이션을 가능케 해준다. VIE 리터러시 교육은 이미지의 상상력과 문학적 텍스트의 건강한 언어적 기능까지 포괄하는 통합적 영상 미디어 교육이다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-9119			KJD:ART001992957		J	Pass,, Charlotte; Czirr,, Lisa								The Role of Visual Literacy in Close Reading								STEM Journal	영상영어교육(STEM Journal)			16	2			191	209							2015	2015	Visual literacy is essential for an in-depth comprehension of all forms of text, defined broadly as all forms of media. The ability to interpret visual text requires interpretive skills which must be taught explicitly. One method of examining visual representations involves close reading. The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) that are in place within US schools include an emphasis on close reading of all texts. In particular, the close reading of visual texts presents special challenges for teachers and students lacking interpretive skills. For English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students and English-language learners (ELLs), visual interpretive skills can help bridge and promote their English-language learning. This article will discuss the CCSS as well as specific strategies to address visual literacy in the classroom and its importance beyond. Through various examples, the authors also discuss the necessity of close reading when encountering graphics and other visual representations, some of which may be misleading or confusing. Furthermore, visual literacy is not limited to charts and graphs. Advertisements and other representations of data, both online and in other venues, similarly require close analysis for increased comprehension. Consequently, the need exists for teachers and students to read beyond the superficial overview of imagery.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-1002			KJD:ART001996060		J	Linenberger, Kimberly J.; Holme, Thomas A.								Biochemistry Instructors' Views toward Developing and Assessing Visual Literacy in Their Courses								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				92	1			23	31		10.1021/ed500420r					JAN 2015	2015	Biochemistry instructors are inundated with various representations from which to choose to depict biochemical phenomena. Because of the immense amount of visual know-how needed to be an expert biochemist in the 21st century, there have been calls for instructors to develop biochemistry students' visual literacy. However, visual literacy has multiple aspects, and determining which area to develop can be quite daunting. Therefore, the goals of this study were to determine what visual literacy skills biochemistry instructors deem to be most important and how instructors develop and assess visual literacy skills in their biochemistry courses. In order to address these goals, a needs assessment was administered to a national sample of biochemistry faculty at four-year colleges and universities. Based on the results of the survey, a cluster analysis was conducted to group instructors into categories based on how they intended to develop visual literacy in their courses. A misalignment was found between the visual literacy skills that were most important and how instructors developed visual literacy. In addition, the majority of instructors assumed these skills on assessments rather than explicitly testing them. Implications focus on the need for better measures to assess visual literacy skills directly.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000348335200005		B	Carpe, Inma; Garcia Rams, M.

Today's students increasingly inundated with a steady stream of imagery from multimedia platforms including the Internet (i.e., social media - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), television, film and advertisements (White, 2012) are global consumers of media in their everyday lives yet they often lack the skills necessary to move beyond passive receivers of visual media messages. Visual literacy is vital for 21st Century learners and those who teach. Classrooms can become spaces for students to effectively communicate in and contribute to analytical and global dialogue for discussions of race and diversity, multicultural life and history thus encouraging students to become active deconstructionists of visual grammar.

"Sometimes the Perspective Changes": Reflections on a Photography Workshop with Multicultural Students in Italy								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION				17	3			56	75		10.18251/ijme.v17i3.954					2015	2015	This article describes and evaluates an 8-week photography workshop, FotoLab, conducted in Italy at an afterschool-tutoring program for students acquiring Italian as an additional language. Seventeen students, age 817 and originating from 9 countries, participated. Co-facilitated by three international educator-researchers, FotoLab's purpose was to promote selfexpression, collaboration, and visual literacy. Through a qualitative inquiry of the FotoLab curriculum, photographs and videos, field notes, and student questionnaires, this article reflects on themes of multiculturalism and multilingualism, collaboration, and visual literacy within a sociocultural animation framework. While expressions of cultural and linguistic identity emerged, findings emphasize the challenges and benefits of teamwork and shared learning. Participants expressed growth in their ability to create and interpret images, a perception affirmed in weekly presentations of their photographs and in a culminating, community event. Overall, outcomes highlight the flexible and dynamic nature of sociocultural animation as an effective practice for multicultural-multilingual contexts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1934-5267			WOS:000409625200004		J	Radcliff, Sharon; Wong, Elise Y.								Evaluation of sources: a new sustainable approach								REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW				43	2			231	250		10.1108/RSR-09-2014-0041					2015	2015	Purpose - The purpose of this study was to test a method of teaching information literacy, using the Toulmin method of argumentation, to aid students in developing topics, evaluating sources and creating stronger arguments that avoided "myside" or confirmation bias.Design/methodology/approach - The Toulmin method of argument analysis was tested in two related studies. A quasi-experimental comparison study in six sections of English composition courses was implemented at a small liberal arts college. Atraditional one-shot session was compared to a flipped class, incorporating Toulmin argumentation. A Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) test was administered and research papers analyzed using a rubric. A modified version of the Toulmin method, using images, was implemented in a two-unit information literacy course at a state university. Pretest and posttest information literacy test scores and research papers were analyzed.Findings - The first study showed that the experimental group performed better on the rubric scores for research papers when results were adjusted by excluding the one honors section. The survey results from this study showed mixed results for the flipped classroom approach. The second study showed a statistically significant improvement in pretest and posttest scores from the information literacy achievement test and the research paper rubric analysis showed that instructional goals were at least partly met.Research limitations/implications - Further research in incorporating instruction in argument into information literacy instruction is indicated. These studies integrated the Toulmin method successfully but represent fairly unique situations and thus more studies are needed to assess the overall impact of using this method in the context of information literacy instruction.Social implications - This study was implemented with two different population groups and shows how instruction can impact different groups differently and can be adapted to increase its effectiveness.Originality/value - The study highlights the value of collaborative assessment and of inclusion of critical thinking goals in information literacy instruction through instruction in argumentation using textual and visual means.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0090-7324	2054-1716		WOS:000212073900006		J	Woyshner, Christine; Schocker, Jessica B.

To examine the extent to which Black women are represented visually and to explore how they are portrayed, the authors use a mixed-methods approach that draws on analytical techniques in content analysis and from visual culture studies. Their findings reveal that Black women are marginalized in high school history textbooks. Also, the authors argue that despite this dearth of Black women, they are portrayed in a greater variety of roles in the major Black history textbook on the market for secondary students. The study concludes by deriving a framework by which others may interpret the representation of Black women in texts and other curricular materials and by challenging traditional content analyses by bringing the notion of cultural parallax to bear on the widely used content analysis methodology.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0093-3104	2163-1654		WOS:000437992400001		J	Lindner, Rachel; Mendez Garcia, Maria del Carmen					Mendez Garcia, Maria del Carmen/0000-0001-9414-2699			The Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual Media: exploring images of others in telecollaboration								LANGUAGE CULTURE AND CURRICULUM				27	3			226	243		10.1080/07908318.2014.977910					SEP 2 2014	2014	Positioned against the background of the Council of Europe's interest in developing intercultural competence through education, the study presented in this paper investigates the impact on intercultural visual literacy of the Council of Europe's Images of Others - An Autobiography of Intercultural Encounters through Visual Media (AIEVM). In our study, the AIEVM was used within the context of an online intercultural exchange between pre-service language teachers. Findings indicate increased intercultural awareness as students at universities in Germany and Spain engaged with the visually 'mediated other' through working systematically with the AIEVM. Multiperspectivity and critical cultural awareness in particular were shown to be enhanced through discussing 'images of others' in culturally diverse tandem teams.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0790-8318	1747-7573		WOS:000345132800002		J	Cerkez, Beatriz Tomsic								Perceptual Literacy and the Construction of Significant Meanings within Art Education								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION				33	2			272	285		10.1111/j.1476-8070.2014.01770.x					JUN 2014	2014	In order to verify how important the ability to process visual images and sounds in a holistic way can be, we developed an experiment based on the production and reception of an art work that was conceived as a multi-sensorial experience and implied a complex understanding of visual and auditory information. We departed from the idea that to foster processes that encourage constructions of significant meanings it is necessary to abandon vision/audio-centric notions of objecthood and offer a general definition of the perceptual object.The test was realised between the participants after modifying the performance conditions: some could not see the visuals, some could not hear the sound and others could appreciate the performance as a whole. Considering the results, we could infer that only the possibility to 'read' the performance as a whole encouraged construction of significant meanings. It would be possible to upgrade the approach, turning visual literacy into perceptual literacy, to contextualise artistic production that stimulates hybrid sensitive experiences. The education of critical perceivers should also enable transformations in responses to different stimuli. This is important if we consider the individuality of each student, his or her needs, affinities, cultural background, gender and so on.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1476-8062	1476-8070		WOS:000340070900009		J	White, John Wesley; Hungerford-Kresser, Holly								Character Journaling Through Social Networks								JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT & ADULT LITERACY				57	8			642	654		10.1002/jaal.306					MAY 2014	2014	Countering reactionary attempts to ban social media from schools is a strong research based rationale for bringing social media into the literacy classroom. When used as a medium to explore literatureor more specifically for interactive character journalingthis medium exemplifies how meaning is created by individuals' interactions with texts, by the prior knowledge they bring to their reading, and by the negotiation of meaning by participants in this digital third space. Used this way, social media can scaffold reading, promote critical discussions about texts, prompt basic sociohistorical research, and engage students in examining discourse, and provide an authentic venue for students to practice code-switching. This study highlights that social media is anything but an educational distraction; rather, when used appropriately it can serve as an engaging and interactive foray into socially-mediated literacy and constructivist learning.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000335063400006		J	Reis, Ricardo								Um olhar sobre o papel das tecnologias da visão na construção de noções e práticas de literacia visual entre os jovens	Un regard sur le rôle des technologies de la vision dans la construction de notions et de pratiques de littératie visuelle parmi les jeunes	A glance at the role of vision technologies in the construction of notions and practices of visual literacy among young people	Una mirada sobre el papel de las tecnologías de la visión en la construcción de las nociones y prácticas de los alfabetismos visuales entre los jóvenes					Revista Lusófona de Educação				0	26			83	102							2014-03	2014	This article is the result of a current research on “the role of school in the development and social highlighting of visual literacy” and is also a first analysis of the evidences collected. The methodology is based on the use of visual research methods and interpretation of the collected evidences, as well as on documental analysis of programs, curricula and educational projects. This article focuses on research procedures with youngsters from two Portuguese public schools. The advent of new technologies and the impact that they have in our lives led to a reassessment of the concept of literacy, leading to the acknowledgement of multiliteracies or new literacies. The notions, practices and strategies shown by the youngsters are analyzed and categorized in a straight relation between shared images and the discourses that made sense during the work sessions, and they are framed in six categories that correspond to six images sets. I intend to give clues to clarify the processes of analysis, interpretation, reinterpretation, appropriation, evaluation, and also creation, made by the young people during this research. I don`t intend to present conclusions but instead to suggest clues to reflection about which are the notions and practices in the visual literacy field that pass through young people discourses.

Each such sign system models and communicates various aspects of "Estonia", adding simultaneously its medium specific signs to the concept. The dominating visual representations circulating internationally about Estonia are photo albums, postcards, films, web pages and other iconic items. Photo albums in particular are constituted by the orthoscopic parameters of painting and the innocent notion of 'picturesque'. In Estonia these albums present hardly anything else than architecture and weirdly empty environment. The reason for this might be a long-term impact of ideology of the past that still tends to constitute an idealist kaleidoscopic overview of the country with no social dimension and its problems as a part of it. The modest level of visual literacy is obviously another reason of the endencies of representation that we observe in this research.

Getting beyond the traditional art education, VCAE has expanded its scope of interest to include the visual environment that surrounds our life, thus pushing the boundary of art education beyond the traditional fine arts to cover pop culture and visual art. VCAE shares the issues as well as a lot of elements of culture and art education and in fact serves as a major theoretic background for culture and art education, in that it pays attention to the sociocultural context of images and emphasizes visual literacy and constructionist learning.In this paper, I have reviewed the theoretical background and related issues of VCAE with a view to presenting a direction for animation education, which is gaining in importance coming into the Age of Digital Media. VCAE was born in the progressive cultural atmosphere from the 1970s and thereafter, and its gist consists in figuring out visual artifacts and their action in order to improve individual and social life. Yet, VCAE continues with its development according to the changing aspects of visual culture, and currently, it is expanding its scope of interest to cover the esthetic, experiential education in visual culture and construction of meaning through digital story-telling. In the visual environment of the Digital Age, animation is establishing itself as the center of the visual culture, being a form that goes beyond an art genre or technology to realize images throughout the visual culture. Also, VCAE, which has so far emphasized visual communication and critical reading of culture, would need to reflect the new aspects of the visual culture in digital animation across the entire gamut from experiencing to understanding and appreciating art education. In this paper, I emphasize on Cross-Curricula, social reconstruction, the expansion of animation education, interests in animation as a digital media, and animation literacy. A study of animation education from the perspective of VCAE will not only provide a theoretical basis for establishing animation education, but also enrich the content of VCAE, traditionally focused on critical text reading, and promote its contemporary and futuristic orientation.				시각문화교육은 포스트 모더니즘 이후, 미술교육의 새로운 패러다임이라고 볼 수 있다. 시각문화교육은 전통적인 미술교육에서 우리 주변을 둘러싸고 있는 시각 환경으로 그 관심의 폭을 확대하였으며, 전통적인 순수예술에서 대중문화 및 영상예술 등으로 미술교육의 관심을 폭넓게 확장해 왔다. 시각문화교육은 이미지를 둘러싼 사회문화적 맥락에 주목하고, 비주얼 리터러시 능력을 강조하며 구성주의적인 학습을 강조한다는 면에서 문화예술교육의 이슈와 많은 부분을 공유하고 있으며, 실제로 문화예술교육의 주요한 이론적 배경이기도 하다.이 글에서는 디지털 미디어 시대와 더불어 중요성을 더해가고 있는 애니메이션 교육의 방향성을 제시하기 위해, 시각문화교육의 이론적 배경 및 이슈를 살펴보고, 이와 관련하여 애니메이션 교육의 방향을 제시하였다. 시각문화교육은 1970년대 이후의 진보적인 문화적 배경 아래에서 탄생하였으며, 그 요지는 개인적이고 사회적인 삶의 개선을 위해 시각적 인공물과 그 행위의 의미를 파악하는 것이다. 그러나 시각문화교육은 시각문화 양상의 변화에 따라 지속적으로 발전 중이며, 현재에는 시각문화에서의 미적 체험교육이나, 디지털 스토리텔링을 통한 의미 구성등으로 그 관심을 확장하는 중이다. 디지털 미디어 시대의 시각환경에서 애니메이션은 시각문화의 중심에 자리잡고 있으며, 애니메이션은 하나의 예술장르, 혹은 테크놀러지를 넘어 시각문화 전반에 걸쳐 이미지가 구현되는 형식이기도 하다. 그간 시각적 의사소통 및 비판적 문화 읽기 등을 강조해 온 시각문화교육 또한 미술교육의 체험에서 이해, 감상에 이르기까지 전 영역에 있어서 디지털-애니메이션 시각문화의 새로운 양상을 반영할 필요가 있을 것이다. 이 글에서는 애니메이션 교육 영역의 확장, 범교과적 접근, 사회재건주의적 교육철학, 애니메이션 리터러시 등을 강조하였다. 시각문화교육적 관점에 기초한 애니메이션 교육의 연구는 애니메이션 교육의 정립에 이론적 토대가 될 뿐 아니라 전통적인 비판적으로 텍스트 읽기 중심의 시각문화교육을 내용적으로 풍부하고 동시대적이고 미래적인 방향성에 도움을 줄 수 있을 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-009X			KJD:ART001889449		J	안인기								Visual Culture Education after the Discourses of Visual Literacy			시각적 문해력 이후의 시각문화교육					Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			15	1			55	74							2014	2014	In this paper, I want to show the limit and the potential these lie hidden in the theory and practice of the visual culture education(VCE). Visual culture education or visual culture art education appear on the art educational stage tp adopt the age after visual turn. It was the major discourses to improve the abilities through the concept of visual literacy, critical thinking, and empowerment to learners. Despite the positive contribution for the field of contemporary art education, I doubt the VCE discours for it's limits. It's not enough to confirm the threat of visual image and to make change the latent of image world. For looking into my topic, I took a tracing the emerging stage of VCE with the articles of Duncum who was one of the leading scholar in this field. Through re-reading texts, I can find the inherent weakness of theory of VCE in general. Furthermore, according to Deleuze and Guattari, I inquire into the system of the VCE theories. It's for the other possibilities for VCE in the gaze of outsiders. This allows the line of flight from the stratum of VCE that follow the regime of representation and Identity politics. Alone Deleuze and Guattari, VCE can reach the plane of difference and becoming, another the virtual.				본 논문은 시각문화교육의 이론과 실천에 잠재하는 어떠한 한계를 해소하기 위한 한 연구이다. 이미지 시대에 대한 미술교육의 대응으로 부상하여 많은 관심을 모은 시각문화교육은 학습자에게 비판적 사고와 역량강화라는 가능성을 제공하려던 담론이었다. 이 연구에서는 시각문화교육의 긍정적인 기여에도 불구하고 문해력, 비판성과 연관된 담론과 교육 실천들이 현실의 시각문화가 지닌 잠재적 가능성과 위협을 생산적으로 간파하고 의제화 하는데 성공적이지 않다는 인식을 바탕으로 한다. 이를 검토하기 위해 시각문화교육의 논리가 구상되던 초기 국면을 던컴의 논의를 통해 살펴본다. 이는 시각문화교육의 이론 안에 보편적으로 내재된 약점의 원인을 찾고자 하는 이유에서이다. 나아가 들뢰즈와 과타리의 사유를 빌어 시각문화교육을 논리를 검토해 본다. 이 점은 시각문화교육의 이론 외부에서 그것의 다른 가능성을 구성하기 위한 시도이다. 이를 통해 시각문화교육이 전제하는 재현 체계와 동일성의 정치학을 벗어나 차이와 생성의 체계로 변화하는 가능성을 타진한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART001848477		J	백윤소								Research on Visual Literacy Education Method through Popular Culture			대중문화를 통한 시각적 문해력 교수법 연구					Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			15	1			95	112							2014	2014	Nowadays, popular culture is developed by high technology and science, this is continually made and consumed by public. Modern people are exposed to popular culture images very long time because popular culture which are movie, graphic, advertisement is likely to be offered and spent in anywhere. The enjoyments provided by popular culture images could not ignore, these could be especially attractive for young children. Thus, it is necessary to have visual literacy education because they tend to accept visual images provided popular culture without critic. Therefore, in this study, I suggest my pedagogy of visual literacy education based on Paulo Freire’s pedagogy of literacy. Firstly, I gave art lesson my 6th grade students with the movie 《Iron Man 3》 using my pedagogy for visual literacy. The end of the lesson, my students realized the involved meaning and could read and write the visual images from that movie. Secondly, preliminary teacher study using my pedagogy is included with the Lotto advertisement in this essay but that could not be applied to students. However, it is meaningful to teach students using that case. Because that advertisement includes overflowing mammonism, students need to learn the right values and critical thinking about materials. Using advertisements is so effective to teach the visual literacy that there are a lots of studies about that. So I, lastly, hope extensive utilization of popular culture (e.g. movie, soap opera, music video) for the visual literacy.				현대사회는 과학과 첨단 기술의 발달로 인해 대중문화가 폭발적으로 성장하고 확산되었다. 대중문화는 대중매체와 대중들에 의해 수없이 만들어지고 소비된다. 현대의 대중문화는 영상 매체들을 통해 제공되고 소비되는 경우가 많기 때문에 현대인들은 대중문화 이미지에 많은 시간동안 노출된다. 그러나 대중문화는 시장 논리에 의해 좌지우지되고 대중문화 이미지가 제공하는 즐거움의 요소들이 치명적인 매력을 가지고 있다. 이에 따라 학생들은 대중문화와 대중문화 이미지를 비평적인 시각에서 수용할 필요가 있다. 따라서 대중문화를 무비판적으로 수용하는 경향이 있는 초등학생들에게 시각 이미지를 문화 속에서 읽고 쓰는 능력 신장을 위한 시각적 문해력 교육이 필수가결하다. 이와 같은 문제 인식과 함께 대중문화를 통한 시각적 문해력 교수법 연구를 위해 흥행한 영화를 소재로 삼아 초등학교 6학년 학생들을 대상으로 현장 연구를 시행하였다. 이 연구에서는 광고를 소재로 삼은 예비교사의 시각적 문해력 교수법 연구에 대해서도 함께 살펴보고자 한다. 결과적으로 현장연구를 통해 초등학생들은 자신이 영화를 그저 재미로만 보고 비판적인 시각으로 살펴보지 못했다는 점을 인식하였으며, 예비 교사의 연구를 통해 광고를 통한 교수법 연구의 효율성과 중요성을 인식하게 되었다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART001848483		J	Shin, HyunKyoung								The Meaning of ‘Vitality’ Reflected in Face Lines of Sun God and Moon Goddess at Jip-an Koguryo No. 4 Tomb's Mural Paintings			高句麗壁畵 五盔墳 四號墓 벽화 日月神 얼굴의 형태선에 드러나는 생명성의 의미					Korean Aesthetics	민족미학			13	2			149	182							2014	2014	The paper deduces the concept of 'vitality' from the lively outline of the faces of Haesin (Sun God) and Dalsin (Moon Goddess) on Koguryo Tumulus Murals focusing on No.4 tomb of No.5 cemetery. Vitality means the energy that an artist transfers to their picture which was initially inorganic, transforming it to organic. I attempt to find that the grounds contained in the outline of the mural painting, at the very moment when the artist creates a work, which is a transference process of unity among the nature/universe, the body and mind of the human, and material and basis. Vitality comes alive when an artist works with the right-brain centered cognition. This vitality goes beyond human-centered division.In this paper, I will attempt to confirm the meanings mentioned above. First, injecting life into a picture of material is a work to prove Koguryo artists' monistic world view. Second, in the working process, an artist understands the world with their right brain function and combines the energy of the universe/nature, the mind and body of humans, and materials. It is an overall unity of combining two worlds divided by a human's left-brain centered view beyond time and space. Third, it helps people to communicate as human to human; an artist's right hemisphere of brain centered recognition and painting are combined with the viewer's right hemisphere of brain centered consciousness which shares its symbolic feature in a monistic perspective. Then, the viewer's understanding represents the meaning in the outlines of the artist's visual world, and, through the process, the human body and mind become re-united. Last, the characteristics of liveliness are delivered not only through its actual mural image but also through its duplication. It can be understood that vitality born from an image is passed on to everywhere.This study takes the whole approach; focusing on an artist's working process, concentrating on the writer's visual literacy (ability of seeing and using images), comparing with other works, re-painting the pictures of the Sun God and Moon Goddess in order to have a deeper visual sense, and introducing the adjacent humanities concepts. In particular, “seeing” with right-brain centered visual recognition comes with intuitive and emotional actions. Based on this concept, the reseacher approached her study with visual literacy which is a way of seeing things based on the connection of body and mind as a artist/researcher/teacher(A/R/Tography).				본고는 高句麗壁畵 五盔墳 4號墓 벽화인 해신 달신의 얼굴에서 전달되는 살아있는 느낌을 형태 선을 중심으로 찾아 ‘생명성’으로 개념화하고 그 의미를 찾았다. 그림의 생명성은 고구려 화공/작가가 작업하는 과정에 그의 기가 우주를 아우르며 자연/우주와 인간의 몸과 마음이 물질인 재료와 합일되면서 살아있는 창조물로 잉태된 것을 의미한다. 이러한 생명의 회화화 과정은 직관과 감성을 담당하는 우뇌의 작용으로서, 화공이 우뇌를 활용하여 그림을 그리는 순간에 통관적 기능이 작용하였기 때문이라고 보고 있다. 화공의 이러한 지각 방식은 개념적 지각이 아닌 관계적 지각으로 대상을 바라보는 시각이다. 그리고 가시 세계를 나타내는 형태선의 생명성 뿐만이 아니라 형태선이 내포하고 있는 상징적 의미를 전달하며 가시 세계와 비가시 세계를 연결한다. 이러한 그림의 생명성과 상징성은 화공의 일원론적 세계관을 반영한다. 해신 달신 얼굴을 보고 살아있는 사람처럼 만나게 되는 관객의 체험 또한 일원론적 세계관 안에서 고대인들의 문화적 인식을 공유하면서 우뇌의 통관적 기능이 작동하는 순간이 된다. 그림/물질을 통하여 시공간을 초월하면서 인간/화공 대 인간/관객의 소통이 이루어지는 작용인 것이다. 이는 마술과 같이 무기체인 그림은 살아있는 유기체로 변화하여 총체적으로 관객에게도 전달되는 작용으로서 현대의 지각 방식이라 할 수 있는 이성적 논리와 문자적 사고를 담당하는 좌뇌의 개념적 인식으로는 제대로 이해할 수가 없다. 그래서 우뇌의 관계적 지각 방식을 심층적으로 접근하기 위해 몸과 마음으로 보고 느끼는 비주얼 리터러시(Visual Literacy, 이미지를 보고 활용하는 능력)라는 개념으로 초석을 세우고자 하였다. 이를 위하여 작가의 제작 과정에 주목하면서 작가이자 연구자이며 교육자(Artist/Researcher/Teacher, A/R/Tography)로서의 본인의 정체성을 적극적으로 활용하여 근접 인문학의 연구와 개념들과 병행하여 통합적으로 접근하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			2233-9981			KJD:ART001950457		J	김해경								A Study on the Way to Improve Pre-service Teachers’ Visual Literacy through an Activity Analyzing a Soap Opera			드라마 분석을 통한 예비 초등 교사들의 시각적 문해력 향상 방안 연구					Korean Journal of Culture and Arts Education Studies	문화예술교육연구			9	6			93	112							2014	2014	The visual images that the moderns are confronted continually in daily life are different from diverse aspects of the visual images that were included in the existing art education field. When we accept visual images produced in modern society without question, we cannot avoid internalization of commercial intent, prejudices and fixed ideas about culture, race, gender, etc in the visual images. In order to analyze and interpret of the visual images in modern society, a new approach is needed different from appreciating and criticizing artworks. Visual culture is included in art curriculum since 2007 Revision of National Art Education Curriculum. The purpose of this research is to strengthen visual culture art education in elementary education by studying pre-service teachers’ visual literacy who will educate elementary school students to analyze and interpret visual images and search the way to improve pre-service teachers’ visual literacy. To achieve this research goal, I asked pre-service teachers to analyze and interpret a heroine’s character of a soap opera based on visual images. The collected data was separated into denotation and connotation: the part describing visual elements were categorized as denotation, the part interpreting the meaning contained in visual elements were categorized as connotation. Then, I focused on analyzing which visual elements were used to interpret visual images. I found some pre-service teachers did not analyze visual images rather that simply described visual images or wrote about a heroine’s character. And most pre-service teachers’ used only visual elements that convey meanings in a direct way and did not used visual elements that convey meanings in a metaphorical and subtle way.				현대인들이 생활 속에서 끊임없이 접하게 되는 시각 이미지들은 기존의 미술교육에서 다루어 오던 이미지들과 제작 의도부터 다르다. 현대의 시각 이미지들을 무비판적으로 수용하게 되면 그 안에 담겨 있는 상업적 의도나 문화, 성 등에 대한 편견들을 그대로 내면화하게 될 위험이 있다. 이러한 시각 이미지들을 올바르게 분석하고 해석하기 위해서는 기존의 미술교육에서 미술품을 감상하고 비평할 때 사용해왔던 관점과는 다른 관점이 필요하다. 2007 개정 미술과 교육과정부터 시각문화는 미술과 교육과정의 일부가 되어 초등학교에서 교육되고 있다. 현대의 시각 이미지들을 분석하고 해석하는 것을 지도해야 할 예비 초등 교사들의 시각적 문해력에 대해 연구하여 그들의 시각적 문해력 향상 방안을 모색함으로써 초등 교육에서의 시각문화 미술교육을 강화하고자 하였다. 예비 초등 교사들이 시각 이미지를 어떻게 해석하는지 알아보기 위하여 시각 이미지에 기초하여 TV 드라마 속 여자 주인공의 캐릭터를 분석하도록 하였다. 수집된 분석문은 시각적 요소 묘사 부분을 외연으로, 시각적 요소에 담긴 의미 분석 부분을 내포로 구분하여 시각 이미지의 의미를 분석하기 위해 어떠한 시각적 요소를 사용하였는지에 중점을 두어 분석하였다. 분석 결과 예비 초등 교사들 중 일부는 시각 이미지를 분석하는 것에 대한 의식이 부족하였다. 또 대부분의 예비 초등 교사들은 1차적으로 주목하게 되는 시각적 요소에만 집중하고 보다 간접적이고 은유적인 방식으로 의미를 전달하는 시각적 요소들의 활용은 부족한 것으로 드러났다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1975-6186			KJD:ART001951665		J	Farías, Miguel; Araya Seguel, Claudio								Alfabetización visual crítica y educación en lengua materna: estrategias metacognitivas en la comprensión lectora de textos multimodales	Critical visual literacy and education in mother tongue: Metacognitive strategies in the reading comprehension of multimodal texts							Colombian Applied Linguistics Journal				16	1			94	104		10.14483/udistrital.jour.calj.2014.1.a08					2014-01	2014	In the context of today's changing sociosemiotic landscape of discourse interactions, in this paper we outline a proposal for critical visual literacy of multimodal texts in language education. Two models are used to analyze a single text; the first one, Magariños (1991), offers the possibilities for thorough visual readings in nine relations that encompass form, existence and value. The other, a sociosemiotic model by Kress and van Leeuwen (1996), breaks down the visual space into four quadrants that account for the ideal, real, new and given dimensions in the design of multimodal discourse. Results indicate that Magariños' model proved to be more effective in exploring signs and their overarching cultural meanings, as constructed in multimodal texts. In turn, Kress and van Leeuwen's offered more possibilities for the analysis of the structure and organization underlying the design and text-image relations in multimodal texts. Through the application of these models it was possible to evaluate the pedagogical potential of critical visual literacy and its contribution to develop new competences that aim at both raising learners' critical thinking and fostering new strategies in language learning and teaching.	En el contexto del cambiante paisaje sociosemiótico de interacciones discursivas de hoy, en este trabajo esbozamos un programa de alfabetización visual crítica de textos multimodales para la educación en lenguas. Exponemos un análisis de un texto multimodal desde dos modelos semióticos y evaluamos sus posibilidades de exploración en procesos de significación. El primero, Magariños (1991), propone una amplia lectura visual a partir de nueve relaciones entre forma, existencia y valor; el segundo, Kress y van Leeuwen (1996), adscrito a la semiótica discursiva, descompone el espacio visual en áreas que articulan lo ideal, lo real, lo dado y lo nuevo en el diseño textual. Los resultados indican que el modelo de Magariños resulta más efectivo en la exploración de los signos y las amplias significaciones culturales plasmadas en los textos multimodales; en tanto, el de Kress y van Leeuwen ofrece mayores posibilidades de indagación de la estructura y organización del diseño y las relaciones entre texto imagen en textos multimodales. La aplicación de estos modelos permite evaluar las potencialidades didácticas de la alfabetización visual crítica y sus contribuciones al desarrollo tanto de nuevas competencias de pensamiento crítico de estudiantes como de innovadoras estrategias pedagógicas en la enseñanza y aprendizaje de lenguas.								1	0	0	0	0	1			0123-4641			SCIELO:S0123-46412014000100009		J	Vidauskyte, Lina								Visual Literacy: Metaphor or Oxymoron?								Logos-Vilnius					81			6	19							2014	2014	Human beings have always looked at and seen the world around them and have made sense of themselves and others through their understanding of what they saw. Writers, too, have always dealt with the visual world. From the ancient Greek philosophers, through the art writers of the Renaissance and the aestheticists of the early Enlightenment, to the art historians, film critics and media theorists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, humanity studied visual forms and their meanings. In this article we distinguish the tacit understandings people have of the visual domain from what we call visual literacies.The problem of the concept of "visual literacy" relates to the "pictorial turn" situation in Western. culture. Some analogies can be traced to compulsory primary education in the second half of 19th century which spread literacy over Western and Eastern Europe. Is, then, "visual literacy" the appropriate concept? As a notion "literacy" metaphorically means the ability to catch any sense from a picture, text etc. Also, the concept "visual literacy" is probably an oxymoron? A phenomenological experience of "visuality" and "literacy" shows that in both cases we are dealing with different intentionalities. On the one hand, it is a reading of image (Aristotle, Horatius, various contemporary theories of literature etc.), and on the other hand, it is the phenomenological experience of visuality (J. W. Goethe, V. Shklovsky, S. Sontag, G. Didi-Huberman etc.).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0868-7692			WOS:000348621800001		J	Yeom, Eun Young								Magic Spells Decoded: Disparate Thematic Messages of Cinderella Picture Books by Two Different Illustrators								The Journal of Teaching English Literature	영미문학교육			18	3			133	157							2014	2014	In picture books, visual images play a paramount role in imparting the author’s and the illustrator’s intended messages. Illustrators often embed certain messages in pictures, thus adding new meanings to the corresponding text. Especially, the embedded ideas within the images can engender different thematic messages from a same story, for example a world-famous fairy tale Cinderella, or the Glass Slipper. This article examines the imagery of the innocent heroine from two picture books; and how differently the ideal virtue of femininity is portrayed depending on illustrator’s intentions, thereby conveying disparate ideal feminine virtues by different illustrators and altering the thematic messages of the story although the verbal contents carry the same Cinderella myth. Innocenti’s Cinderella is described as a unconventional and confident young woman while Brown’s Cinderella embodies the traditional concept of ideal woman who is submissive, fragile and blond young lady. The present study illuminates the understanding of how to read visual images of picture books that picture book reading should be an active process in which readers/viewers attend to visual details; and decode hidden messages and artists’ intentions to complete the whole meaning of a story. The findings are closely related to critical visual literacy, which is vital component to survive in the 21st century and could be developed through critically reading picture books.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-2249			KJD:ART001947729		J	Pantaleo, Sylvia								Reading Images in Graphic Novels: Taking Students to a 'Greater Thinking Level'								ENGLISH IN AUSTRALIA				49	1			38	51							2014	2014	During a classroom-based study that explored the teaching and learning of visual elements of art and design, Grade 7 students had the opportunity to read four graphic novels. Theoretically, the research was informed by social semiotics, visual literacy, sociocultural theory, and Rosenblatt's transactional theory of reading. The instructional unit of the research involved the students participating in a variety of activities that focused on a selection of visual elements of art and design and graphic novel conventions. As well as reading, responding in writing, and discussing a selection of picturebooks, graphic novels and magazine issues, the students had two opportunities to apply their learning and compose their own multimodal texts. This article features the findings from the content analysis of the students' written responses to Sidekicks (Santat, 2011), one of the graphic novels featured in the study. Data analysis revealed the Grade 7 students' high level thinking about and aesthetic appreciation of the visual elements of art and design and graphic novel conventions that were under study. The analysis of the data also revealed how learning about the what, why and how of the mode of image and the medium of comics affected the students' responses to Sidekicks.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0046-208X			WOS:000344985600005		S	Mammino, Liliana						Eilam, B; Gilbert, JK		The Interplay Between Language and Visualization: The Role of the Teacher								SCIENCE TEACHERS' USE OF VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS		Models and Modeling in Science Education		8				195	225		10.1007/978-3-319-06526-7_9	10.1007/978-3-319-06526-7				2014	2014	Teaching and learning depend on communication. Language is the first and most fundamental communication tool and instrument of thought. Because of its conceptual components, science education requires adequate language-mastery sophistication.Visualization is a very important communication tool, capable of: providing complementary explanations reinforcing and clarifying those provided by the text; focusing learners' attention on aspects and details that would otherwise remain unnoticed; familiarising learners with entities that are not part of direct experience, like the invisible world of atoms and molecules in chemistry; expressing trends through diagrams; and conveying complex ensembles of operational information that would be too lengthy and less efficient to express through language, like the information on how to build something, typical of engineering projects.Handling (reading, interpreting, drawing) images relevant to science learning and science communication requires specific training. The training is realised through language and, therefore, the development of visual literacy depends on language mastery and is unavoidably poorer when language mastery is poorer. Experience has shown that the interplay between language and visualization is an important key to pursue the maximum development of visual literacy attainable under given educational circumstances (i.e., considering the background preparation and communication abilities of a given group of students) and, at the same time, maximum clarification of the concepts concerned. This interplay can be managed only by the teacher and can become an important tool both for explanation and for in-class interactions.The chapter analyses the main features of the interplay and outlines implementation pathways, illustrating them with a number of concrete examples. The analysis and the explored implementation options are the outcomes of direct experience in an underprivileged context where both the language mastery and the visual literacy of students entering university need substantial upgrading to become functional to learning. Information about the difficulties encountered by students in this context has been collected systematically in the last 15 years within the first year general chemistry course and the undergraduate and postgraduate physical chemistry courses, utilising both students' works and classroom interactions as sources. The information has been utilised to design implementation options, and students' responses have been utilised for subsequent re-optimisations of the options. Inferences are drawn from patterns in the documentation collected and in students' responses (including the general inference on the pedagogical importance of the interplay between language and visualization). It is further considered that educational approaches designed to promote underprivileged students can benefit all the other students, as they are designed with particular attention to ensure clarity and to avoid taking any prior knowledge for granted.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1871-2983		978-3-319-06526-7; 978-3-319-06525-0	WOS:000343470500012		J	Jeong, Yeon Hee								A Research of Developing Visual Literacy Through Photographic Education ‪- Focused on Upper Elementary Grades and Students-			비주얼 리터러시 향상을 위한 사진교육 연구- 초등학교 고학년을 중심으로 -					AURA				32				102	120							2014	2014	Today we are surrounded by flooding visual images. In this situation, elementary students whose judgement is inadequate should promote the visual literacy ability to rightly receive and utilize images. Photography is the most proper means to cultivate the visual literacy and its training requires sufficient time and system. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to take the photographic education to improve the visual literacy as a single subject. Considering preceding researches of the teaching plan of visual literacy using photography, the direction was established about how to realize the photographic education to improve visual literacy. In conclusion, it was confirmed that when the visual literacy-based photographic education was applied, the visual cognitive ability, the critical reception ability, the proper utilization ability, the active production ability and the creative modeling ability were improved. Especially it was found out that more effect is expected when conducting the photographic education not as part of fine arts subject, but as a single independent subject.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1228-503X			KJD:ART001849496		J	Vidauskyte, Lina; Sodeika, Tomas								Media Philosophy: Visual Literacy and Orality (Seminar)								LOGOS-VILNIUS					78			77	84							2014	2014	On February 28, 2014, at University of Klaipeda a seminar Media Philosophy: Visual Literacy and Orality took place.

According to Jacobs (2005:475) "many students at tertiary institutions in South Africa are not first language English speakers, denying them ready access to content information which is taught through the medium of English at most tertiary institutions". For first language speakers, English as a medium of instruction therefore constitutes a barrier to successful learning.To assist non-mother tongue speakers to study successfully in English, interventions are planned in the first year to assist students towards "epistemological access": to use and apply English for academic dialogue, debate and reflection.These interventions can broadly be classified into two types of interventions: On the one hand stand-alone academic literacy courses which are credit bearing (for example 6 credits or 60 notional hours); and on the other hand mainstreaming of academic literacies: the integration of academic literacies into the taught curriculum.Whereas a case is made out for standalone courses to reportedly assist students from dysfunctional schooling environments, this discussion will rather focus on ways and means to integrate academic literacies into the mainstream curriculum via the 'flipped classroom'. Integration of academic literacies into each and every module in the Curriculum will yield more learning hours in total than a stand alone academic literacy course of 6 credits or 60 notional hours. The integrated literacies or curricular approach to academic literacies constitutes an inbuilt multiplier in this instance.Within the flipped classroom, that "what happens inside the classroom happens outside the classroom": techniques such as Mazur's Just-in-time (diagnostic questions before the start of lectures for students to prepare and to bring along to discuss in class), "canned" mini lectures published on Blackboard Collaborate LMS before lectures and after-lecture consolidation exercises via LMS social network instruments such as WIKIS or Blogs.Mazur's Just-in-Time technique was refined by the creating a before lecture Language Gymn or a before lecture Maths Gym to improve academic literacies in both reading and writing skills and quantitative literacy. A vignette (short case study drawn from the prescribed textbook) was published before lecture on an LMS; students underline main concepts, paraphrase these concepts and then produce a summary. This summary was then verified in the lecture. By the same margin lecture specific mathematical computations (contextualized in a real-life problem or scenario) were published before the lecture for the students to attempt. The same process was used to teach visual literacy: the ability to read and produce graphs.Additionally a workbook or Textbook Chapter wrap-around was provided to students to record their answers. The workbook contained incomplete mind maps, incomplete conceptual hierarchies and process map - in cases where set procedure needed to be taught. Care was also taken to transform the Textbook Chapter Outcomes into (assessment) questions and exercises (Bigg's constructive alignment).Within the flipped classroom scenario students attend lecture for answers, use academic dialogue in think-pair-share exercises in large classes; and peer work for verification: skills much needed to survive the complexities of the 20th century and beyond.					7th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)7th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 17-19, 2014NOV 17-19, 2014		Seville, SPAINSeville, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1095		978-84-617-2484-0	WOS:000367082903055		S	Jimenez-Montano, Mayra; Ortiz-Rivera, Laurie						Kurbanoglu, S; Spiranec, S; Grassian, E; Mizrachi, D; Catts, R		Development of Visual Skills: Digital Photography as a Tool for Research and Teaching in Architectural Education								INFORMATION LITERACY: LIFELONG LEARNING AND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE 21ST CENTURY		Communications in Computer and Information Science		492				407	416							2014	2014	An architect's education requires a broad mastery of visual skills. Particularly in design courses, students must demonstrate the skills necessary for the use and production of images to achieve a competitive academic performance. However, the development of these skills in students and the evaluation of their work by faculty members are based mostly on subjective criteria supported by the faculty's experience. The research used digital photography as an object of research to understand the processes of learning in architectural design. The results help to establish new educational strategies for the development of visual skills to be used during the design process. The collaboration between faculty members and librarians of the School of Architecture at the University of Puerto Rico presented new partnerships that have enriched the planning process of different pedagogical activities for the advancement of knowledge with the development of visual literacy skills in students.					2nd European Conference on Information Literacy (ECIL)2nd European Conference on Information Literacy (ECIL)	OCT 20-23, 2014OCT 20-23, 2014	Zagreb Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Sci; Hacettepe Univ, Dept Informat ManagementZagreb Univ, Dept Informat & Commun Sci; Hacettepe Univ, Dept Informat Management	Dubrovnik, CROATIADubrovnik, CROATIA	1	0	0	0	0	1			1865-0929		978-3-319-14136-7; 978-3-319-14135-0	WOS:000377252400043		S	Radcliff, Sharon						Kurbanoglu, S; Spiranec, S; Grassian, E; Mizrachi, D; Catts, R		Teaching Information Literacy Using Argument, Alternative Perspectives, and Images								INFORMATION LITERACY: LIFELONG LEARNING AND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE 21ST CENTURY		Communications in Computer and Information Science		492				474	483							2014	2014	This paper reports on a pilot study conducted at a medium-sized state university in California.

We also seek to discuss the extent to which the analyzed sample provides a comprehensive and critical reading of visual texts. The analysis was done based on interpretive epistemology, the sociocultural approach to literacy, and visual language syntax, which can contribute positively to the analysis of visual discourse. We concluded that the image in the sample is presented from sociocultural approaches, that the reading activities foster visual literacy, and that teachers' support plays a significant role in adopting approaches to reading and in conducting reading activities per se.		Em vista da grande multiplicidade de linguagens e considerando que a alfabetização é uma importante prática de letramento na constituição da criança, este artigo tem o objetivo de identificar o tipo de abordagem dado à imagem em um livro didático do 1º ano (EF), aprovado pelo PNLD (2010). O intuito é discutir em que medida a amostra analisada favorece uma leitura compreensiva e crítica do texto imagético. Para tanto, as ponderações foram realizadas por meio de uma epistemologia interpretativa, à luz da teoria dos letramentos sob uma perspectiva sociocultural, e também a partir da sintaxe da linguagem visual, que pode trazer uma contribuição positiva às análises discursivas visuais. A pesquisa indica que a imagem é proposta a partir de perspectivas socioculturais; que as atividades de leitura favorecem o letramento visual e que a condução do professor pode fazer diferença nas abordagens e leituras.							0	0	0	0	0	0			2176-4573			SCIELO:S2176-45732013000200002		J	Barbot, Baptiste; Randi, Judi; Tan, Mei; Levenson, Cyra; Friedlaender, Linda; Grigorenko, Elena L.

We present a new visual-literacy based instructional approach-and its underlying theoretical model-in which museum educators introduced children and their teachers to works of art in a museum setting, then guided teachers to bring visual images and art objects into the classroom to present children with new visual experiences, increase their visual and verbal skills, and, ultimately, promote their development as writers. A set of three multi-method exploratory studies is then presented to examine key aspects of the instructional program: (a) observations of children's verbalizations in a group discussion of a work of art before and during exposure to the program; (b) examination of story-writing skill development in a pre-posttest control-study design; and (c) retrospective interview analysis, tracing the underlying thinking processes engaged during a visual-literacy based writing activity. Although the new instructional approach presented here is still under development, preliminary results show promise that visual-literacy practices may facilitate children's development of writing skills with regard to vocabulary, narrative structure and originality, through a better sense of observation and increased inferential thinking.

Both wild and domestic animal visuals have been used in both countries' education of mother tongue. The most frequently used skill in visual reading is the reading skill. However, for each of the 3 age groups, English books preferred to show animals alone in their natural environment while Turkish books preferred to use more than one animal of the same species in their natural environment for the purpose of reinforcement England is the country that uses the animal visuals best. Because the animal visuals prove to be meaningful and necessary where they are used, while this ratio is much lower in Turkey with no more than 50%. As a result, it can be concluded that England has acted with more care in use of animal visuals compared to Turkey.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0972-0073			WOS:000323112000033		J	Styles, Maggie; Williams, Brian; Humphris, Gerry				Williams, Brian/G-5736-2012	Williams, Brian/0000-0003-0000-4354			Is the effectiveness of tobacco image-based warning labels likely to vary by socio-demographic variable?

Countries have increasingly adopted the use of images as warnings on cigarette packs. We aimed to investigate the likely differential impact of varied images and messages on sub-groups of the United Kingdom (UK) smoking population.Methods: Forty two images developed and approved by the European Union (EU) were viewed by participants in an online survey. Respondents indicated which images they felt would most effectively reduce rates of smoking. Socio-demographic data was sought from participating adults including age, sex, occupation, ethnicity and current smoking behaviour. There were 19,810 participants in the survey.Results: Three images, with graphic content, were found to consistently stand out as the most popular across all sub-groups. Smokers (as opposed to ex-and non-smokers) and men were found to vote for significantly fewer images, potentially indicating greater scepticism regarding the efficacy of images. Significant socio-demographic variations across a number of images were found suggesting that particular images and messages may have a differential impact on particular sub-groups.Conclusion: Images may vary significantly in their impact on different social sub-groups. Careful consideration is required when selecting which images to use. Attaching images targeting a sub-group to tobacco brands with that socio-demographic market may enhance the effectiveness of such warnings.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0017-8969			WOS:000318652400013		J	김지원								A Study on Experimental Typography through Visual Literacy - focusing on the experimental books of Warren Lehrer -			시각적 문해력을 통해서 본 실험 타이포그래피에 관한 연구 - 워렌 레러(Warren Lehrer)의 실험 서적들 중심으로 -					Bulletin of Korean Society of Basic Design & Art	기초조형학연구			14	5			121	133							2013	2013	A feature shown in the typography works experimental trend shown in the later part of 1980s is that the boundary of text and image has become more ambiguous. In other word, the text not only has the function to deliver the basic characters but also shown in image or image become text depending on situations. Therefore, the readers that are faced with the contemporary typography are encountered with the ‘new reading method’, namely, ‘visual literacy’, as positive and participating attitude as readers to read text to image or text to text to mutually co-exist, disintegrate and converge each other beyond reading the graphic messages with passive attitude of traditional method. Under this thesis, it is intended to study on how to generate the game following ‘visual literacy’ through the <Artist Book> works of Warren Lehrer that experimentally re-structured size, shape and arrangement of characters by converting the text into an image, not linear reading pattern with certain direction. Contemporary readers encountering the works of Warren Lehrer may take the unique reading method of each individual with the positive and participating attitude as readers and may further experience the reading of diverse and open structure. This is to encourage the readers for ‘visual literacy’ of new open structure, not ‘simple and one-way message conveyance’ through the experimental typography works, and it presents the dynamic communication of multi-dimensional work interpretation through the foregoing. In addition, this study on 'visual literacy’ is intended to expand the contemporary graphic design expression territory that is required to ceaselessly recreate the visual messages and present the possibility for unlimited expression of the potential typography domain and possibility of experimental re-structure in future.				1980년대 후반부터 나타난 실험 작품에서 나타나는 대표적인 특징은 텍스트와 이미지의 경계가 점점 모호해 진다는 것이다. 즉 텍스트는 기본적 문자 전달 기능뿐 아니라, 상황에 따라 이미지화 되기도 하고, 때로는 거꾸로 이미지가 텍스트화 되기도 한다. 그래서 현대 독자들은 텍스트와 이미지 또는 텍스트와 텍스트가 서로 공존, 해체, 융합하는 탈경계 방식의 실험 타이포그래피를 읽어낼 수 있는 능력이 필요해졌다. 다시 말해  ‘시각 정보들을 올바르게 이해하고 해석하며, 비판적으로 분석하고, 창의적으로 재생산하여 의사소통을 할 수 있는 능력’을 의미하는 ‘시각적 문해력(Visual Literacy)’이 필요한 것이다.본 논문에서는 시각적 문해력을 통해서 본 워렌 레러(Warren Lehrer)의 일정한 방향성을 가진 선형적인 독해 구조가 아닌, 텍스트를 이미지화하여 글자의 크기, 형태, 배치를 실험적으로 재구성한 실험 서적들의 다양한 시각 조형 언어들과 실험정신, 표현양식의 특징이 무엇인지 살펴보고, 독자에 따른 다의적 해석의 가능성들을 연구해 보고자 한다. 이는 일정한 방향성을 가진 선형적인 독해 패턴이 가지고 있는 ‘단순하고 일방적인 메시지 전달’이 아닌, 새로운 열린 구조의 ‘시각적 문해력’을 현대 독자들에게 독려하는 것이며, 이를 통해 전통적 의미의 개인적이고 사색적인 작품 감상에서 벗어나 즉각성, 복합성, 용이성, 다양성 등의 장점을 향유하는 창조적 작품읽기를 경험하게 할 것이다. 아울러 시각 메시지를 끊임없이 재창조해야 하는 현대 타이포그래피 비전의 방향을 진단하고, 미래의 잠재된 타이포그래피 영역의 무한한 표현 가능성과 실험적 재구성의 확장 가능성을 제시하고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-8635			KJD:ART001817375		J	김지원								A Possibility of Polyvalent Interpretation of Post-Modern Graphic Design - focusing on the Competency Factors of Visual Literacy -			포스트모던 그래픽디자인의 다의적 해석의 가능성- 비주얼 리터러시 역량요인을 중심으로 -					Journal of Basic Design & Art	기초조형학연구			14	6			71	82							2013	2013	The post-modern graphic design has strong experimental trend to respect diversity, individuality and personality. With the trend of getting more and more ambiguous boundary of text and image, there is an emergence of a boundary-breaking method of mutual existence, disintegration and convergence. Therefore, contemporary readers are required to have more aggressive and participating attitude in graphic work interpretation that there is a need of ‘having the competency for correctly understanding visual information, interpretation of such information critically and reproduce in creative ways to communicate’, or namely, ‘visual literacy’. The purpose of this thesis is to search for possibilities on polyvalent interpretation of post-modern graphic design through 4 competency factors on visual literacy (superficial approach, context approach, creative approach, and communicative approach). For this purpose, the intent is to take a look at the territorial expansion and changes in the post-modern graphic design territory and formulate the contemporary implication of the visual literacy concept to study the relativity with the post-modern graphic design. Through this attempt, this thesis is ultimately purported to encourage the contemporary readers for the ‘new way of reading’, namely, the visual literacy, a new open structured reading method as breaking away from the one-dimensional way of thinking for superficial approach to read the formative language through the visual literacy, and it also purports to expand the potential graphic design territory of future by formulating the polyvalent interpretation and detailed design methodology of the post-modern graphic design through the visual literacy. In addition, a differentiated implication is on presenting another direction of experimental restructuring as well as unlimited expression possibilities in the post-modern graphic design that is to recreate the visual messages unyieldingly.				포스트모던 그래픽디자인은 다양성과 개별성, 개성을 존중하는 실험적 성향이 강하다. 텍스트와 이미지의 경계가 점점 모호해 지며, 서로 공존, 해체, 융합하는 탈경계 방식을 보여준다. 이에 현대 독자들은 그래픽 작품해석에 있어 더욱 적극적이고 참여적인 자세가 필요해진 상황으로 ‘시각 정보들을 올바르게 이해하고, 비판적으로 해석하고, 창조적으로 재생산하여 소통을 할 수 있는 능력’ 즉 ‘비주얼 리터러시(visual literacy)’가 필요한 것이다.본 논문의 목적은 비주얼 리터러시 역량요인 4가지-조형요소와 조형원리를 읽는 표면적 접근, 조형적 은유체계를 읽는 맥락적 접근, 해체와 재구성을 통한 창조적 접근, 독자의 다양한 해석을 만들에 내는 소통적 접근-를 통해서 본 포스트모던 그래픽디자인의 다의적 해석에 대한 가능성을 모색하며, 현대적 의미의 비주얼 리터러시 개념을 도출하고 포스트모던 그래픽디자인과의 관계성 연구이다. 이를 통해 본 논문이 궁극적으로 의도하는 바는 비주얼 리터러시를 통해 ‘조형언어를 읽어 내는 표면적 접근의 일차원적인 사고’에서 벗어나 새로운 열린 구조의 독해방식인 ‘새로운 읽기 방식’ 즉 ‘비주얼 리터러시’를 현대 독자들에게 독려하는 것이며, 비주얼 리터러시를 통해서 본 포스트모던 그래픽디자인의 다의적 해석과 구체적인 디자인 방법론을 도출하여 미래의 잠재된 그래픽디자인 영역을 확장시키는 의도이다. 아울러 시각 메시지를 끊임없이 재창조해야 하는 포스트모던 그래픽디자인의 무한한 표현 가능성과 실험적 재구성의 또 다른 방향을 제시하는데 차별적 의의가 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-8635			KJD:ART001841629		J	Cho, Chul-Ki								Visual Literacy-Based Teaching and Learning Strategies   For Using Geographical Photographic Materials			비주얼 리터러시에 기반한 사진 활용 지리수업 방법					Journal of the Association of Korean Photo-Geographers	한국사진지리학회지			23	1			13	23							2013	2013	This study is to reinterpret the role of photographic materials in teaching and learning geography and inquiry the new ways of using them. Until recently photographic materials have played a part for visual recognition of the fact, but now need to be used for the evidence of geographical phenomenon. It has to be recognized in teaching geography that photographic images is not a transparent window on the world, but the products of representation selected by producer consciously or unconsciously. With this epistemic turn, Photographic images is viewed as object that students have actively to read for searching for the evidences and meanings. Students can learn the skills of visual literacy and ways of seeing through the process of inquiry. Thus, teachers need to support the effective scaffolding frameworks like visual frame and development compass rose, and the teaching and learning strategy such as the speculative talk and the Chinese whispers so that students acquire the skills.				이 연구는 지리수업에 자주 사용되는 사진 자료의 역할을 재해석하고, 새로운 활용 방법을 모색한 것이다. 지금까지 지리수업에서 사진 자료는 사실에 대한 시각적 재인을 위한 역할을 주로 수행했다면, 이제 지리적 현상에 대한 증거로서 기능할 필요가 있다. 이를 위해서는 지리수업에 사용되는 사진 자료가 세계를 비추어 주는 창이 아니라, 그것을 만든 사람들의 의도적 선택뿐만 아니라 무의식적 선택을 반영하는 재현의 산물로 인식되어야 한다. 이러한 인식론적 전환 속에서 지리수업에 사용되는 사진 자료는 학생들이 증거와 의미를 찾아내기 위해 능동적으로 독해해야 할 대상이 되며, 이를 위해 학생들에게는 비주얼 리터러시와 보는 방법이라는 기능의 학습이 중요하게 된다. 따라서 교사는 학생들이 이러한 기능을 효과적으로 학습할 수 있도록 도와 줄 수 있는 비전 프레임과 개발나침반과 같은 비계 장치를 비롯하여 추론적 대화와 차이니즈 위스퍼스와 같은 수업 전략을 구사할 필요가 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			2288-9795			KJD:ART001758365		J	Ki, JungHee; 박일우								Encountering the World through Image Reading : development of a convergent liberal education curriculum between humanities and arts			인문학Â·예술 융복합 신규 교과목 <그림읽기로 세상보기> 개발					Korean Journal of General Education	교양교육연구			7	6			11	41							2013	2013	This article aims to develop a liberal education curriculum that converges humanities and arts. By humanities, we mean the linguistic literacy that enables to translate specific images to text. This curriculum is designed on the base of the visual semiotics, which has been developed with its interdisciplinary character.The development of the curriculum has an important principle: how to help the student, the future civilized citizen, to enjoy the art work and enhance their artistic sensibility and creativity. So as to interpret and re-construct the meaning of the image, we proposed a methodological approach defined in art history and modified in visual semiotics, the iconological point of view.Further, the curriculum aims to help students their linguistic literacy. We believe that enhancing the linguistic literacy, whether spoken or written, is the most important mission to which today's liberal education must concentrate its effort. To do so, the curriculum consists of several writings: on-line debate, and report on museum visit and subsequent report.Since there are few curricula that comprise humanities and arts, we hope that <Encountering the World through Image Reading> will fulfil its role to be a successful convergence one not only in the local institution but nation wide liberal education field.				이 연구는 인문학과 예술의 융합을 통한 새로운 교양교과목을 개발하는 것을 목적으로 한다. 이 수업에서 인문학의 영역은 그림을 ‘읽어내고’ 이를 글로 옮기는 능력과, 예술 작품을 접하면서 얻게 되는 감수성, 창의력 제고와 정서순화, 나아가 자아정체성의 발견을 포함한다. 이 연구의 이론적 배경은 그 자체로서 학제적 성격을 지니는 시각기호학이다. 따라서 이 수업은 다의적인 이미지를 읽어내는 도구로써 미술사에서 발전되고 시각기호학에서 수정된 도상해석학적 접근방법을 제안한다. 이 교과목은 또한 학생들로 하여금 오늘날 교양교육이 매진하여야 할 글쓰기 능력을 제고할 수 있는 방안으로 온라인 토론, 팀프로젝트, 미술관 방문 보고서를 주요 평가항목으로 삼는다. 예술은 그 자체의 교육적 가치에도 불구하고 국내 대학의 교양교육과정에서 지금까지 소홀히 다루어진 영역이다. 연구진은 연구결과 개발된 <그림읽기로 세상보기> 교과목이 이 문제에서 하나의 대안을 제시할 수 있기를 희망한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1976-3212			KJD:ART001836879		J	Leekyoungyul								The Diversified Perspective and the Reception Aesthetics in Reading Photograph			사진 읽기의 다변화된 관점과 수용미학 - 사진적 행위와 비주얼 리터러시에 관한 존재론적 연구 -					Semiotic Inquiry	기호학 연구			37				239	275							2013	2013	There are two methods, which are mutually different, in readingphotographic image. One is the epistemological perspective of analyzinga scene focusing on code message. As another is a situational cause, itis the ontological perspective of understanding it as un-coding message.In case of the former, a photo becomes resemblance of object(image-icon)or analytical object(image-symbol) as the outcome of photography andalso becomes unilateral message of text literary in the sphere ofcommunication. However, in case of the latter, a photo relies upon theprinciple of photo-index as genese rather than the outcome of image, namely,as a cause that made the photo exist. What is important there relies uponreading the diversified image as image-index, which designates anyexistence.Also, there are three perspectives that are mutually different in readingthe diversified photographic image : There are the perspective ofsujet-spectrum in Latin, which first analyzes photographic message in therelationship between the image and its demonstrative object, the perspectiveof sujet-operator in Latin, which grasps operator's intention between theimage and the productive moment in the image, and the perspective ofsujet-spectateur in Latin, which speaks of spectator's situationalre-construction between the image and the reception moment.Reading photographic image today is not the general analysis on image from the perspective of sujet-spectrum, which is accustomed to logic andanalysis, but what understands any ontological intention and idea ofsujet-operator and also what implements pragmatics of sujet-spectateuras a user of image. The visual literary in a photo is never the deliveryand analytical interpretation of unilateral message, but relies on positiveimagination of sujet-spectateur, which points to post-construction and openspace. Especially from the perspective of operator, which produces photo,and from the perspective of audience, which accepts photo, the photois not originally the outgoing sign of releasing bon sens any more, butthe receiving sign of accepting and distributing a meaning in pragmatics.Ultimately, as the right understanding of photographic image is a conceptof visual literacy, which is understood as the horizon of the open analysis,it relies especially upon not unilateral but mutual communication and uponthe diversified image. Reading photographic image in today's image-actcan be seen to move from the structualism to which we are accustomedfor a long time, namely, the analytical perspective of sujet-spectrum, tothe diversified perspective of sujet-operator and sujet-spectateur. In thisway, the visual literacy becomes a new method, which makes it overcomethe epistemological limit of the text literacy through the photographicact, which makes it available for mutual communication especially betweensender and receiver, in addition to the diversified perspective of readingphotographic image.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-3172			KJD:ART001838979		J	Hattwig, Denise; Bussert, Kaila; Medaille, Ann; Burgess, Joanna								Visual Literacy Standards in Higher Education: New Opportunities for Libraries and Student Learning								PORTAL-LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMY				13	1			61	89		10.1353/pla.2013.0008					JAN 2013	2013	Visual literacy is essential for 21st century learners.

These Standards present new opportunities for libraries to expand their role in student learning through standards-based teaching and assessment, and to contribute to campus-wide collaborative efforts to develop students' skills and critical thinking with regard to visual materials.									24	0	0	0	1	24			1531-2542	1530-7131		WOS:000314563000004		B	Subramani, Sunthararajan R.; Wolf, Karsten D.; Stiefs, Dirk						Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		REFINING BY DRAWING FOR INITIATING INQUIRY WITH STORYBOARDS IN SCIENCE CLASS								6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2013)								6341	6349							2013	2013	The motive of a science class is to impart knowledge on various phenomena, to engage students to reciprocate and reflect on what they have learned and to make them develop an inquiring mind. Various media such as books, images, videos, etc. are widely used as tools in science class for presenting phenomena and facts. Media is also used as a means of developing the cognitive ability of the users; by making them develop their own media that directs their attention to the science facts. Therefore, media plays a very vital role in science classes today, and we have to look deeper into the potential of digital movie-making and the role of visual representation. Science classes already use diverse visual representations like diagrams, maps, pictures, graphs, animations and movie sequences. For visual understanding and communication, students have to learn and develop their visual language skills. Storyboards are one of the most powerful media through which students can develop their visual language skills. They are used as a visual tool in movie making, for presenting facts in an organized way and complex information can be transferred in a feasible way, through visual representation using the storyboards.Based on recherche and creative imagination movie production starts with the development of the story, after deciding on the topic, location, time and characters. The backbone of movies is the story structure. Narrating a story is the process of connecting events and actions together in a meaningful way. The models of story structures are diverse, because different disciplines like literature, anthropology, psychology, semiotic and film studies have different points of views on the storytelling. The theory of Greimas on narrative structures has been useful for the authors to understand the cognitive activities, needed to translate individual observations and knowledge into stories by using storyboards. Drawing storyboards can be turned into a cognitive activity that evokes the motivation to refine an idea, untill it becomes communicable. In several case studies, students formed teams of virtual broadcasters that explored a topic from natural science in the context of a research lab. The teams were given the task of handling a specific topic and documenting their results in a movie that communicated the facts to their classmates in an entertaining way. This specific setting reflects several didactic methods, especially Learning by Teaching (LdL). This paper identifies the potential of a project setting that combines creative inquiry with digital movie-making including their visual tools in a science lab. The potential, by stimulating the imagination of the students and transforming it into creativity, is one of the most efficient ways for inquiry-based approach that motivates engagement in science classes.					6th International Conference on Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)6th International Conference on Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 18-20, 2013NOV 18-20, 2013		Seville, SPAINSeville, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-84-616-3847-5	WOS:000376253200065		S	Carrascal Dominguez, S.; Lopez Cobenas, E.; Bueno Villaverde, A.; Caballero-Garcia, P.

These didactics propose a bigger level of critical nature from the students, developing abilities and operational competences inside a "what to teach?" (De Zubiria, 1994). This means achieving through modern practices the emotional and sentimental development of each individual inside a "know how to do" and "know how to be", in line with the demands of the new society of knowledge and information. Therefore, we need a content of audio-visual literacy inside schools, with the purpose of proving the importance of this dynamic and its repercussion in the citizen nowadays and of tomorrow (Beltran y Calderon, 2007).These and other reasons justify the need to develop in out youth competences that facilitate the critic reception of media, getting a better reading of the messages they consume, and consequently, the negative effects the media produces in their personal and social development can be decreased. This, along with school, starting in the first educational stages and continuing progressively towards the whole educational system until reaching the University, must to contribute to teach students abilities and competences that allow them perform a better role inside society. The audiovisual literacy is established as a vehicle to get such purpose.Visual Arts in Education (VA.E) is an investigation project based in the teaching and learning of the contemporary visual arts in pre-school and primary education. Its principal aim is to analyse the use and practice in educational centres SEK of the Community of Madrid, of a didactic suitcase created by the General Subdirection of the Promotion of the Fine Arts of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports: The KIT E.CO.This didactic material was designed as a proposal of visual literacy for children between 4 and 10 years of age. Its main purpose is motivate them in a process of analysis and discovery of the images, through playing, comprehending, valuation and understanding of the visual arts. In this way, they become protagonists of the process of creating their own visual code. The project we present belongs to a parallel investigation from the general purposes of the project, whose objectives are evaluating the didactic part of it. It will analyse the development of the cognitive and affective capacities that will be produced in the child of those ages with the use of the KIT, just like the achievement of key objectives in the learning through images and, all of that, from investigation units, in the scope of an international and bilingual education.					7th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)7th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 04-06, 2013MAR 04-06, 2013		Valencia, SPAINValencia, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1079		978-84-616-2661-8	WOS:000346699806103		S	Sokirkina, L.

However, visual skills development has not received attention it deserves in the University context. Another neglected area is the correlation of visual literacy skills with several generic skills which are important for University students to acquire before they enter the highly competitive job market. The paper discusses how visual and generic skills are incorporated in the Foundation Programme (FP) of Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Oman. The results of a conducted study provide insights into the unique socio-cultural educational SQU context in which visual and generic skills must be developed, reveals challenges that both students and the faculty face and discusses possible ways to foster those skills development.					7th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)7th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 04-06, 2013MAR 04-06, 2013		Valencia, SPAINValencia, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1079		978-84-616-2661-8	WOS:000346699801078		J	Sohn, Jihyun								A Study on Reading Visual Culture Images for Creativity and Character Education			시각문화 읽기를 통한 창의Â·인성 교육					ART EDUCATION REVIEW	조형교육			47				65	86							2013	2013	The purpose of this study is to interpret visual culture images using a strategy of emotional writing with personal analogy. This study investigates the process and result of utilizing personal analogy for ways of encouraging imagination of viewers and connection with their experience. Based on the concept of a whole human being with aesthetic sensitivity in 2009 National Art Curriculum, the author suggests the need for critical interpretation of visual culture. Design of curriculum development is suggested for creative thinking by using clustering, imagination, and visualization in context of divergent thinking of individuals. Then viewers need to write by starting with "I am- ". The process of writing "I am- " requires careful observation, visual literacy of images by reading denotation and connotation of texts. By sharing writing their interpretation of visual culture images, students can identify beliefs, knowledge, and emotions that affect their identity. As art educators, we need to emphasize the value of visual perception and visual literacy as a way of facilitating social concerns and personal experiences. Discussion could lead insightful reflection of self and others for social justice, multicultural issues, and critical thinking as we live in visual culture environment. Aesthetic sensitivity in art education can be related to students'everyday life and construction of identity by critical analysis of images in personal and socio-cultural context									0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-4177			KJD:ART001797474		J	백윤소								Visual Culture Education and the Implications of Paulo Freire's Literacy Education Program			경험중심의 시각문화교육: 프레이리의 문해력 교육이 주는 시사점					Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			14	2			81	99							2013	2013	The many visual images that people experience in their everyday lives are created by popular culture is controlled by the market economy. Therefore, the meaning of visual images must be comprehended with a critical view; for this reason, visual literacy education is needed. For this research, I consider the importance of experience for visual literacy education by researching J. Dewey’s theory based on experience. Also, I consider the implication of Paulo Freire's literacy education regarding experience for visual literacy education. The visual literacy program is modeled on the Freire's, and I apply this program for students. The stages of the visual literacy education program modeled by this study are as follows: 1) preparatory stage: research culture stage select visual image stage understand narrative stage make metaphor and symbol stage: 2) progress stage: suggest narrative and visual image stage discuss and interpret stage understand meaning stage make meaning stage, and applied the present lesson for the upper-grade elementary school students. Students can improve the ability to understand visual images provided by popular culture and make visual images using based on their comprehension by the visual literacy education program. Also, they grasp the meaning based on their experience, and their able to critically interpret the meaning in a social/cultural/political aspect. In this study, I tried to suggest an applicable method by modeling and applying visual literacy education program to find visual culture education methods using popular culture.				대중문화는 시장 논리에 의존하면서 수많은 시각 이미지를 생산해내고 우리는 이것을 일상생활 속에서 접하면서 살고 있다. 전례 없는 시각 이미지의 폭발 속에 살고 있는 현실에서 시각 이미지가 주는 의미를 능동적으로 파악해야 하는 시각적 문해력 교육이 절실해진다. 본 연구에서는 듀이의 경험에 기반 한 이론을 살펴봄으로써 시각적 문해력 교육에 있어 경험의 중요성을 고찰해본다. 특별히 경험을 중시하는 프레이리의 문해력 교육이 시각적 문해력 교육에 주는 시사점을 밝히고, 이를 바탕으로 시각적 문해력 교육 프로그램을 개발하여 학생들에게 적용해보고자 한다. 본 연구를 통해 개발한 시각적 문해력 교육의 프로그램은 “1) 준비 단계: 문화 조사 단계시각 이미지 선정 단계내러티브 파악 단계은유와 상징 만들기 단계, 2) 진행 단계: 내러티브와 시각 이미지 제시 단계토의 및 해석 단계의미 파악 단계의미 만들기 단계”이다. 그런 다음, 이 프로그램을 초등학교 고학년 학생들을 대상으로 한 실제 수업에 적용해 보았다. 본 프로그램을 통하여 학생들은 대중문화로부터 제공되는 시각 이미지를 이해하고 이를 바탕으로 시각 이미지를 제작하는 능력을 효율적으로 향상시킬 수 있었다. 나아가 학생들은 시각 이미지의 의미를 그들의 경험을 바탕으로 파악하면서 그 의미를 사회적ㆍ문화적ㆍ정치적인 측면에서 비판적으로 해석할 수 있었다. 본 연구는 대중문화를 통한 시각문화교육 방법을 학생들의 경험을 중심으로 하여 시각적 문해력 교육 프로그램을 고안하고 적용함으로써 실제 교육 현장에서 적용 가능한 방안을 제시한 데에 중요성이 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART001784261		J	Fu, Liangyu								Indigenizing visualized knowledge: translating Western science illustrations in China, 1870-1910								TRANSLATION STUDIES				6	1			78	102		10.1080/14781700.2012.724784					2013	2013	This article discusses how the translation of science illustrations operated interculturally in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century China. I examine three categories of translated images: those with transformation in core information, those with alterations in peripheral information and those without any changes. In order to understand the differences between Western images and their Chinese translations, I analyze the nature of science illustrations, the problem of "visual literacy" and the goals of the translators involved. I contend that illustrators' personal understanding of science and artistic training played a significant role in adapting Western images to Chinese visual conventions and thus potentially aiding Chinese readers' access to Western science. Examining the different divisions of labor required by different printing techniques, I argue that even in the face of electrotypography's challenge to human intervention, translators still made some aesthetic choices and balanced them with practical needs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1478-1700	1751-2921		WOS:000311541400007		J	Prior, Lori Ann; Willson, Angeli; Martinez, Miriam								Picture This Visual Literacy as a Pathway to Character Understanding								READING TEACHER				66	3			195	206		10.1002/TRTR.01098					NOV 2012	2012	The literary element of character is critical to literary meaning-making, and in picturebooks images provide information important to understanding characters. This manuscript shares results of an investigation that explored the kinds of pictorial information young children use to gain insights into the characters and provide practical ways teachers can extend their own as well as children's engagement with visual text. Following read alouds of three picturebooks, second graders were shown pre-selected illustrations from the books and interviewed. Insights gained suggest children are aware of important visual information and use certain types of visual information to understand character. Yet, many children were not attuned to several intentional visual devices used by illustrators. Therefore, teachers have important work to do in fostering children's visual literacy. Teachers must value, draw attention to, and explore illustrations and artistic devices illustrators utilize to facilitate visual literacy and character development.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0034-0561			WOS:000310553400004		J	Ferreira, Aparecida de Jesus								Identidades sociais, letramento visual e letramento crítico: imagens na mídia acerca de raça/etnia	Social identities, visual literacy and critical literacy: images in the media about race/ethnicity							Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada				51	1			193	215		10.1590/S0103-18132012000100010					2012-06	2012	This article aims to analyse the representation of social identities of race and ethnicity that underlie the image published in 2005 in the newspaper Folha de SãoPaulo. To put the issue of social identity of race and ethnicity in Brazil in context, I reflect on the question of identity and classification of colour/race/ethnicity. In this article, I propose a learning activity using the references of visual literacy and critical literacy (BAMFORD, 2009; BROWETT, 2009; LANKSHEAR, 2002). I conclude that images published in the media are tools that we can use as a form of critical literacy and thereby contribute to a reading that enables the formation of critical citizens.

Multimedia has been proven to be a powerful learning tool as it is able to provide extensive learning opportunities, thus breaking away from the traditional and restrictive 'chalk and talk' type of teaching. This study examined the incorporation of an after-reading assignment called 'The Multimedia Project' in a literature classroom. It involved ninety-six students taking English literature courses at the Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Multimedia can be defined in a variety of ways, but for this project multimedia refers to a literary text presentation, primarily made using sound and images. Through this project, the students had opportunities to explore and develop their knowledge and critically analyze the literary texts covered in class. This study relied on two types of analysis: an evaluation of the students' multimedia presentations and a survey of the students' opinions regarding the project. The findings indicate that the multimedia project proved to be effective in advancing students' literary experience and critical appreciation. The students' opinions also confirmed the viability of multimedia as a practical application tool in teaching literature as well as in promoting visual literacy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-1145			WOS:000304199900010		J	Milner, Rachel								The effectiveness of images in the development of conceptual understanding in undergraduate biochemistry classes: What do we know?

A system of inquiry and design, developed at CTC over a ten-year period, was used to guide the cooperative making of short student films. Students were asked to (1) conduct a deep exploration into themes and experiences that were personally meaningful and (2) explore the medium of film and how it can be used to express this content.Observations of this process suggest that film was being treated as a language with a vocabulary and syntax of its own. Image composition and sequencing were employed in ways that seemed congruent with the use of words and grammar. There is much in the literature about "Visual Literacy" and the importance of being able to "read" images and use them as a means of expression. (e. g. A. Bamford, 2003; S, Stokes 2002) But experience in this student work begs the question, "Can the solving of communication objectives through the generation and manipulation of images have a positive effect on the communicator's organization of thought, aptitude for critical analysis, and capacity for expression?" And if so, might these advances transfer back to the critical understanding of traditional text-based works and films?As CTC looks ahead to further exploration of student work in filmmaking, this hypothesis is guiding the development of a suggested model for text to visual migration (and back again) through content-mapping (identification of key points in a verbal narrative or film), transitional objects (concrete aids for visualizing content), and frame-by-frame thinking (the ability to understand and express content through a series of sequenced visual or narrative compositions). Furthermore, under consideration is an adaptation to middle school environments (grades 6 to 8) to begin to see if such migration might be universally applied across age groups and disciplines. This leaves us with the question, if students are able to think and express themselves in both verbal and non-verbal modes, will they be better prepared for global communication and citizenry?					6th International Conference of Technology, Education and Development (INTED)6th International Conference of Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2012MAR 05-07, 2012		Valencia, SPAINValencia, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1079		978-84-615-5563-5	WOS:000326396404065		B	Mayer, Richard E.

Digital medium is the salient medium of cyber-space visual cultures and it is essential to understand the meaning of digital medium for visual culture education.People tended to simply regard cyber-space as the virtual reality,figment of imagination. But cyber-space is to truly new type of world. It has not only philosophically existential meaning but also expand body domain up to augmented reality which are really new faces of the real world not exposed to people yet. This is different dimension from the original actual worlds. In cyber-space, Aesthetics focus on gradually the learner's “perception”, not just “beauty”. Thus people concentrate on various perceptions caused by art media and accept ideas of Media theory. This research also has the same point of view.The implications of digital media based on Media theory are presented the following: diversified structures and ways of communicating.expanding of learner's body domain, creation whole new images, an increase aesthetic interest in perception. To achieve this, current visual culture education in age of cyber-space proceed in the direction of communicating through the digital media of visual culture and incorporating the visual tactility as well as various synesthesia of different sensations while experiencing directly. I hope this idea will be effective in growing learner's sensation, perception and ultimately learner's visual literacy.				사이버스페이스를 야기한 디지털 매체의 함의를 기능이나 활용의 측면이 아닌 매체이론의 관점에서 탐색하고 그 함의를 바탕으로 한 시각문화교육의 방향을 찾고자 한다. 디지털 매체가 불러온 사이버스페이스 시대에서 미학적 관심은 ‘아름다운 예술에대한 미학’에서 ‘지각이론으로서의 미학’으로 이동하였고 이는 다양한 디지털 미술작품으로 현실화되고 있다. 매체 이론의 관점에서 디지털 매체는 내용을 중립적으로 전달하는 단순 기술로 이해될 것이 아니라 다원화된 의사소통구조의 실현, 몸의 호환영역확장, 새로운 이미지와 현실 창조, 지각작용에 관한 미학적 관심 증대라는 중요한 함의를 가진다. 이러한 함의가 효과적으로 발휘되도록 디지털이 주류 매체인 현대의 시각문화교육은 상호작용, 다원화, 매체로 인한 직접적 지각 체험을 바탕으로 다양한 감각을 신장하는 방향으로 진행되어야 할 것이다. 이는 시각문화교육의 학습자에게 미술매체에 대한 새로운 인식을 심어줄 뿐만 아니라 다양한 시각문화에 대한 이해와 소통의 폭을 넓혀주는 교육적 효과를 가져 올 것으로 기대한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-0440			KJD:ART001688680		S	Garcia-Varela, A.; Monjelat, N.; Checa, M.; del Castillo, H.; Herrero, D.

New digital technologies can be thought of as instruments that require from the user some understanding of their languages, a "visual literacy" (Gee, 2004) to comprehend the messages conveyed in all its complexity. It is refers to different communication systems that include language, images, symbols, graphs, diagrams, artefacts, etc. In this framework, video games can introduce the students in this multimodal world, since they combine different languages.Our data comes from an ethnographic study (Atkinson et al., 2001; Lacasa & Reina, 2004; Pink, 2004) conducted in a workshop developed in a secondary school in Coslada (Madrid) during Spanish Language subject, while working with The Sims 3 video game. In this research we show how some simulation video games, specifically The Sims 3, can be used as learning resources that help students to develop digital skills while they learn curricular contents in the area of language.We worked from a participatory action research perspective (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2005) assuming a reflexive-dialectical view of subjective-objective relations and connections. In this context we combine analytical and narrative ways of thinking to approach human practice (Bruner, 2002). Moreover, we understand our participatory action research as a process of mutual inquiry wherein researchers and teachers collaborate to "create circumstances in which people can search together collaboratively for more comprehensible, true, authentic and morally right and appropriate ways of understanding and acting in the world" (Kemmis, 2005: 601). In this project, we collaborated with teachers in the process of sharing goals and creating innovative educational activities situated in the classroom context. It helps teachers to analyze their own practices in order to improve their teaching skills.Our works are based in the belief that schools need to develop educational uses for many of the instruments that have not been specifically designed for this purpose, but are meaningful in children's everyday life as videogames. The educational potential of simulation games has become a subject for discussion and research (de Freitas & Oliver, 2006; Mitchell & Savill-Smith 2004) that encouraged us to developed this study. From this particular study our findings revealed that during the workshop students developed new literacies (Jenkins, 2009) by working with different media (Manovich, 2001).The video game and its virtual world enhanced students' creativity regarding linguistic skills. For example they were able to write descriptions of the characters created in the game, using the possibilities and vocabulary offered in it. They also described the environment that they constructed and re-built while playing. At the same time they took pictures and recorded videos from the game. Also, the stories enacted during the sessions gave them a lot of ideas to come up with narratives, that both wrote on paper and showed in audio-visual productions edited using Movie Maker. All this process is an example of the ability that Jenkins (2009) called "appropriation".					4th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)4th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 02-04, 2012JUL 02-04, 2012		Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1117		978-84-695-3491-5	WOS:000326239302015		J	Belk, Russell								Examining Markets, Marketing, Consumers, and Society through Documentary Films								JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING				31	4			403	409		10.1177/0276146711414427					DEC 2011	2011	Documentary film is over 100 years old and includes subgenres such as ethnography, historical film, docu-drama, propaganda, and advocacy videos. With numerous film archives, film festivals, special DVD issues of journals, inexpensive video recording and editing equipment, Internet distribution, and the phenomenal growth of archival Internet sites such as YouTube and Vimeo, there are now hundreds of millions of documentary films and videos available to the interested researcher. The author argues that the macromarketing field has greatly underutilized this vast resource and suggests examples of sources and uses for such material. The author also suggests some aids for acquiring critical visual literacy skills to inform such analyses. Just as we rely on our libraries and online access for books and print journals, we can readily do the same with documentary films. Such analytical projects can be presented as either video documentaries themselves, as text-based articles and books, or as multimedia combinations. Film, video, Internet, and television images arguably do more to influence public perceptions of marketing, consumption, and life than any other medium. There is thus a great opportunity to understand society through this window on the world.									23	0	0	0	0	23			0276-1467	1552-6534		WOS:000298355000005		J	Wuellner, Cynthia Frewen								Beyond economic and value wars: Mythic images of future cities								FUTURES				43	7	SI		662	672		10.1016/j.futures.2011.05.007					SEP 2011	2011	Images of the future are essential to a society's survival. According to Polak [1], images of the future reflect and foreshadow society's future: as images go, so goes society. As a visual medium, cities in particular depend on robust images of the future. I submit that our ability to develop useful images of future cities depends on our visual literacy in understanding architectural images. This study explores alternative futures illustrated with future fantasies as an experiment in connecting images, archetypal myths, and alternative futures. Using two variables (strength of the economy and shifts in social values), four scenarios are proposed: Frontier Freedoms, Urban Fortress, Eco-Survival, and Utopian Hopes. Scenarios of future cities depicted by architectural imagery and linked to worldviews and archetypal myths broaden public discourse beyond economics and technology to address qualitative contextual factors such as identity, community, sacredness, and nature.

Hence, applying visual literacy is an important competence in today's world. Empirical studies point out that drawing on the computer can enlarge pictorial skills and creative-esthetical capabilities of expression of children like painting, staging, collecting and experimenting [1]. But when we look at art education on the computer we find that these creative-esthetical activities are not supported by drawing programs as demonstrated by a short analysis of a few programs used in schools. Thus, art pedagogy reacts too much to the software market instead of playing an active role. Designing learning scenarios only by using commercially available software could however be precarious as the content is imposed solely by guidelines devised exclusively by information scientists: consequently the software only reflects the perspective of software developers and their understanding of creative-esthetical behaviour.In an attempt to unite the perspective of art pedagogy and computer science I initiated the project "Art Pedagogy and Computational Visualistics in a Research Association. Development and Evaluation of Software from a Childlike Point of View". The project is financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In this project children are directly involved in the evaluation and development of software. Thus the esthetical and creative capabilities of children are strengthened and the child's perspective gains importance. When involving children in the research process it is guaranteed that esthetical and pictorial skills, the necessities and motivations of children are the main aspect and not the perception and expectations of adults.As a first result of the project the open source software "GIMP" was modified based on former research from complexity to simplicity. With the help of this modified software fostering creative-esthetical capabilities in art education is now possible.					4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)4th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 14-16, 2011NOV 14-16, 2011		Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-84-615-3324-4	WOS:000317080005085		J	이지연								Conceptualizing Digital Video Literacy to Promote Digital Storytelling								ART EDUCATION REVIEW	조형교육			41				149	177							2011	2011	This paper is about multi-literacies in contemporary art education with particular focus on stipulating digital video literacy to promote the benefits of digital storytelling. The growing importance of digital technology and new media in the field of art education cannot be ignored. Understanding more about the meaning making practices through digital video literacy by incorporating visual literacy, media literacy, and digital literacy is significant topic to discuss. Educating digital video literacy allows students to decipher, interpret, create and understand digital storytelling that is associated with digital technology. Chung (2006, 2007a) presents the possibilities of digital storytelling as a form of interdisciplinary education in art classrooms by arguing that "digital storytelling offers tremendous potential for integrating and teaching contemporary visual culture, greater issues of concern, and multimedia arts to the digital generation"in art education (Chung, 2006: 34). Chung (2006: 34) further elaborates on this notion by relating art education to today’s art. Digital storytelling is applicable to art education because it empowers "art learners to cultivate and apply their multiple literacy, artistic, and critical skills to voice their concerns or address greater issues of significance to an ever larger global audience" I also believe that digital storytelling can be implemented in order to educate students regarding a) critical thinking and discerning eyes, b) an understanding of art elements and principles of videos, c) storytelling through multi-literacies, and d) new types of self-representation, digital ethics and copyrights.The proliferation of digital technologies become relevant to the teaching of contemporary art, and can offer pedagogically diverse aspects of literacies in digital media making. Depending on how those literacies are taught and introduced in art educational settings, students who are digitally literate can achieve competency in communicating with contemporary art. Educating students about this set of abilities (digital video literacy), where visual, digital, and media literacy overlap in digital art classrooms, would allow for new forms of communication, adaptation, understanding, and the transformation to students who are digital natives.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-4177			KJD:ART001605709		S	Jih, Hueyching Janice; Huang, Tzu-Min						Chova, LG; Belenguer, DM; Martinez, AL		STORY TALK SHOW: PRODUCT INVENTION E-STORYBOOK FOR ELEMENTARY SCIENCE EDUCATION								EDULEARN11: 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES		EDULEARN Proceedings						2025	2030							2011	2011	All students have the potential to be creative. Creativity is conceptualized more like athletic ability that can be taught. Educational environment should provide young pupils with learning opportunities supporting creative development. Industrial innovative products like walkman and mobile phones were designed when innovators exchange viewpoints with people from different circles. Students' creativity is also stimulated by encounters with views different from their own. We all can image that stories have a mysterious power which can lead us into the world created by words. Facing the fact that science textbook describes content of scientific and technological inventions in exposition mode mostly, so that elementary pupils are difficult to comprehend. Story mode can support reading comprehension as well as can generate motivation by making links between story episodes and personal experiences. Invention ideas and associated principles can be conveyed with digital story. Digital storytelling could serve as a fun and engaging activity for students to strengthen basic as well as visual literacy, to build knowledge and skills via mastering a paragraph and using inductive reasoning, and most important to incubate curiosity as well as creativity. A picture is worth a thousand words. Invention ideas and associated principles can be conveyed with just an image. Story with a series of drawings to represent abstract scientific concepts can enhance learning, especially for elementary pupils. An e-storybook, entitled Story Talk Show, consists of stories of a series of innovation tools has been designed, developed, and evaluated by this study. The content structure, treatment design, storyboards of episodes, evaluation and revision of this e-storybook form the major parts of this study.					3rd International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)3rd International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 04-06, 2011JUL 04-06, 2011		Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			2340-1117		978-84-615-0441-1	WOS:000326292902007		J	Kim, Jungsun; 박소라								A Study on the Strategy for Improving Visual Literacy through Reading Pictures in a PictureBooks			시각적 문해력 향상을 위한 그림책의 그림읽기 전략 연구					Journal of Art Education	미술교육연구논총			30	0			27	53							2011	2011	The purpose of this study was to examine the strategy of picture-reading in a picturebooks for the improvement of visual literacy. For this, the investigator chose picture books as media of improving visual literacy, drew out formal elements of pictures, namely methodological bases for picture-reading, groped after general strategies of picture-reading, analyzed the meaning of contents, and then applied the strategy to the actual scenes of picture-reading education.In order to achieve study purpose, the strategy of picture-reading was applied to the classes of discretionary activities with the subjects of elementary school fourth-graders according to the strategy of picture-reading and then examined the degree of literacy improvement via a variety of qualitative techniques, such as keeping an observation diary, open participatory observation and interviewing.The investigator hopes children who will be exposed to the environment of visual culture in the future can interpret visual images more positively via picture-reading, have critical minds about it, and create new meaning beyond simply accepting the meaning of visual images.				오늘날 시각 중심의 문화 환경에서 필수적으로 요구되는 ‘시각적 문해력’이 미술 교육의 목표를 달성하는데 중요한 요건임에 근거하여 이 연구는 글과 그림이 상호 보완하여 의사소통하는 독특한 예술 장르의 하나인 그림책을 활용하여 시각적 문해력을 향상시키기 위한 구체적인 방법론으로서 그림책의 그림 중심의 그림읽기 전략을 마련하는 것을 목적으로 하였다. 이러한 목적의 달성을 위하여 그림책 그림읽기를 위한 방법적 근거인 형식적 요소를 추출하고, 내용적 의미를 파악할 수 있는 그림읽기 전략을 제시하였다. 그림읽기 전략은 그림책의 ‘형식’적 측면을 기준으로 하여 그림책 구조 읽기 단계, 그림책 그림 요소 읽기 단계, 그림책 이해하기 단계로 구분하고 이에 근거하여 단계별 그림읽기 전략을 제시하는 형태로 구성하였으며, 초등학교 4학년을 대상으로 재량활동 시간에 적용하여 그 결과를 확인하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-1274			KJD:ART001627456		J	Hea-Soog, Jo; 이효원								Reading group dynamics with the grammar of visual design in Leo Lionni’s picturebooks: Focusing on main character's development of ego			시각디자인 문법으로 읽는 레오 리오니 작품의 집단 역학: 자아 성장을 중심으로					Korean Journal of Early Childhood Education	유아교육연구			31	1			5	24							2011	2011	This study investigates how Leo Lionni's picturebooks communicate a main character's ego development through the grammar of visual design. Four picturebooks in which the main characters’ egos grow though group interactions were selected for this study.

Second, the main characters’ ego growth involves community restoration as well as solving a problem the group has Since images continue to evolve as the dominant text of today’s society, these findings imply that incorporating visual literacy as a component of reading instruction by including strategies for understanding the combination of two levels of communication, that is, words and pictures, would strengthen life-long reading comprehension skills.				본 연구는 Kress와 Leeuwen(1996)의 시각디자인 문법을 통하여 레오 리오니 작품 속 인물의 자아 성장 과정을 살펴보는 것이다. 연구대상 그림책은 집단과 상호작용 속에서 자아가 성장하는 주인공을 다룬 그림책 4권으로, 다음과 같은 결론이 나타났다. 첫째, 레오 리오니 작품에 나온 주인공은 아동문학의 기본 플롯인 집, 집 떠남, 모험, 집으로 돌아옴의 과정을 거쳐 성장하였다. 둘째, 주인공은 한 개인의 성장으로 집단과의 문제를 해결할 뿐 아니라 공동체 회복성까지 가져온 것을 알 수 있다. 디지털 세대를 살아갈 유아에게 그림은 중요한 의사소통 매개체이므로, 시각디자인 문법의 다양한 기능을 통해 그림을 보는 것은 전체 텍스트 이해에 도움이 되며, 유아의 그림 읽기 방안을 제공해주었다는데 의의를 가진다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-9565			KJD:ART001533896		B	Note, Margot	Note, M							Photographic image issues								MANAGING IMAGE COLLECTIONS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE		Chandos Information Professional Series						61	86							2011	2011	Using a postmodern perspective, this chapter discusses the many levels of meaning that images hold simultaneously, urging that photographs must be managed with their context intact. The chapter explores some of the challenges facing information professionals as they endeavor to understand and make accessible the contextual meanings of analog, digitized, and born-digital photographic records. Through its refined notions of what constitutes authenticity, postmodernism offers information professionals an orientation by which to consider the photographic process, to better appraise, preserve, and represent images. Understanding context and connotation improves the ability to provide deeper description of visual holdings and make them more useful and usable to scholars. Additionally, other issues that affect the management of image collections, such as intellectual property rights, legal and cultural considerations, ethics, and preservation, are explored.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-84334-599-2	WOS:000291591600004		J	조용준								A Study on Photography Education and Visual Literacy in Art Museum			미술관에서의 사진교육과 비주얼 리터러시에 관한 연구					The Society of Modern Photography & Video	현대사진영상학회 논문집			14				151	168							2011	2011	Art Education in Art Museum is one of the important functions. Art Museum takes in charge of the essential functions in social education which are for the general public to share art cultures and to be considerate of improving their qualities of life. Photography Educations for adults in Art Museum are growing and beginning to diversified. In other words, People appreciate and criticize photo exhibitions in Art Museum. They also practice photographs directly in Art Museum.Photography Educations in Art Museum need to be harmonized with the concepts of literacy between Tool literacy and Literacy of representation. Skills which enable to handle tools, that is skills which handle with cameras and express objects or interpretations of created messages using new tolls with imagination, learning knowledges that decode created messages, critical view of image and discussion and study make the education. Then the education becomes to be the eyes that gaze the world with balanced stance in the complicated world.In other words, this education makes a critical inmates who live a independent life in media society. And also to foster such citizens is the expanded concept of Visual Literacy Education. Furthermore promoting the Visual Literacy makes it possible to appreciate deeply. This helps greatly to evaluate the artistic functions of works. In conclusion the purpose of this research is searching how to apply the Visual Literacy in Photography Education in Art Museum and examining the educational method of that application.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-3512			KJD:ART001677283		J	Dowse, Ros; Ramela, Thato; Barford, Kirsty-Lee; Browne, Sara					Dowse, Ros/0000-0001-9065-6668			Developing visual images for communicating information about antiretroviral side effects to a low-literate population								AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH				9	3			213	224		10.2989/16085906.2010.530172					SEP 2010	2010	The side effects of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy are linked to altered quality of life and adherence. Poor adherence has also been associated with low health-literacy skills, with an uninformed patient more likely to make ARV-related decisions that compromise the efficacy of the treatment. Low literacy skills disempower patients in interactions with healthcare providers and preclude the use of existing written patient information materials, which are generally written at a high reading level. Visual images or pictograms used as a counselling tool or included in patient information leaflets have been shown to improve patients' knowledge, particularly in low-literate groups. The objective of this study was to design visuals or pictograms illustrating various ARV side effects and to evaluate them in a low-literate South African Xhosa population. Core images were generated either from a design workshop or from posed photos or images from textbooks. The research team worked closely with a graphic artist. Initial versions of the images were discussed and assessed in group discussions, and then modified and eventually evaluated quantitatively in individual interviews with 40 participants who each had a maximum of 10 years of schooling. The familiarity of the human body, its facial expressions, postures and actions contextualised the information and contributed to the participants' understanding. Visuals that were simple, had a clear central focus and reflected familiar body experiences (e. g. vomiting) were highly successful. The introduction of abstract elements (e. g. fever) and metaphorical images (e. g. nightmares) presented problems for interpretation, particularly to those with the lowest educational levels. We recommend that such visual images should be designed in collaboration with the target population and a graphic artist, taking cognisance of the audience's literacy skills and culture, and should employ a multistage iterative process of modification and evaluation.									12	0	0	1	1	12			1608-5906	1727-9445		WOS:000289461800002	25860626	J	Sarmiento Sierra, Marisol								A Guided Reading of Images: A Strategy to Develop Critical Thinking and Communicative Skills	Lectura guiada de imágenes: una estrategia para desarrollar pensamiento crítico y habilidades comunicativas							Colombian Applied Linguistics Journal				12	2			72	86							2010-07	2010	This article describes the effects of a strategy aimed at helping students develop critical thinking and communicative skills by means of a program for guided reading of images using the questioning technique in an EFL context.

These effects cause many changes in issues from social structure to the individual life styles. One of the areas in which these changes appear is the education. The facts that information technologies have developed and started to be used in global level and the interdisciplinary approaches have spread are shaping the education today; because these processes affect the thinking and production processes. As a result of this, while the type of individual who is targeted to be educated is changing, the educators and educational institutions who educate these individuals should be renewed and restructures as well. These changes should be more rapidly and compulsory for the art education primarily; because, art expanding its limits depending on the globalization. The elements like the use of new technologies in mass communication fields, the occurring of novel interaction environments that extend the international borders, knowing new cultures and intercultural interaction have caused important cultural changes and these changes inevitably have shaped the art and art education. In this process, the concepts of post-modernism, multiculturalism, interdisciplinarity and visual literacy have come into prominence. Art approaches that are not limited to traditional materials and prefer the multi styles according to the global effects have been globalizing the art concept. While the art concept is changing and renewing, it also forces the art education to restructure. As a result, a need for planning art education programs that do not ignore the global factors and technological developments in art education arises. In this study, it was attempted to analyze the positive and negative effects of globalization on the art education based on related studies and literature review. As a result of this, it was aimed at answering questions like what the elements that determines the individual that globalization makes compulsory in art education are, what the roles of educators and educational institutions in the education of this individual are and what the educational settings should include.					3rd International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)3rd International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 15-17, 2010NOV 15-17, 2010		Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-84-614-2439-9	WOS:000318797404121		J	Kim, Hyungsook								Redefinition of Cultivation of Aesthetic Attainments through Analysis of University Curriculum			대학교육과정 분석을 통한 미적소양교육의 재개념화					Art Education Research Review	미술교육논총			24	1			51	92							2010	2010	As part of liberal education courses at university, art education about aesthetic attainments enables students to develop critical thinking about the outside world and cultivate artistic and cultural consciousness. With the aim of redefining education aimed at cultivation of aesthetic attainments as part of university's liberal education, this study investigates the progress of liberal education particularly in U.`S. universities and ponders on its implications for liberal education at South Korean universities. Departing from conventional concept of liberal education, European universities already transformed their liberal education curriculum into specialized courses, whereas most universities in the U.S. still adhere to the spirit of traditional liberal education while running specialized courses at professional graduate school. This study contemplates, from theoretical viewpoints, the spirit of liberal education mirrored in the history of liberal education courses, the meaning of education about aesthetic attainments for perceiving visual images surrounding students' lives, and interdisciplinary research methods for practical implementation. Against this backdrop, it also performs some case studies of progress status of education courses on aesthetic attainments currently available at prestigious U.S. universities, thereby exploring the value of art education on aesthetic attainments and its significant implications for South Korean universities. Such analysis of liberal education courses at university demonstrates that education on aesthetic attainments plays a pivotal role in nurturing citizens with critical mindset regarding the outside world by improving students' visual literacy. Moreover, it shows that interdisciplinary approach, expansion of hands-on education programs, and theme-based research methods can act as a crucial methodology for learners to acquire visual literacy from those education courses related to cultivation of aesthetic attainments. Art education on aesthetic attainments herein is only confined to those students not majoring in the fine arts, thus excluding those courses on aesthetic attainments for those students with a major in the fine arts. In conclusion, this study unlocks the value of education on aesthetic attainments to improve students' visual literacy and sheds light on its educational functions as part of university curriculum to foster students into citizens with critical perspective during the prevalence of visual culture.				미적소양교육은 대학교양교육에서 학습자가 세계를 비평적으로 이해하는 사고를 배양하고 예술 및 문화의식을 함양하는데 중요한 역할을 한다. 본 연구는 대학교양교육에서 미적소양교육의 재개념화(再槪念化)를 위하여 미국대학을 중심으로 교양교육의 전개 양상을 살펴보고 우리나라 교양교육에의 시사점을 논의하는데 그 목적이 있다. 따라서 첫째, 본 연구에서는 교양교육의 역사적 전개과정 속에서 함유된 자유교육 정신과 학습자의 삶을 둘러싼 시각 이미지들을 읽는 능력을 기를 수 있는 미적소양교육의 의미, 그리고 이를 구체적으로 실현할 수 있는 학제간 연구 방법론에 대한 이론적 고찰을 행한다. 둘째, 미국의 주요 대학에서 실행되고 있는 미적소양교육을 사례연구를 통해 살펴봄으로 해서, 우리나라 대학의 교양교육에서 미적소양교육의 가치를 발견하고 적용 가능성을 논의하였다. 유럽대학에서는 전통적 교양주의를 넘어서 전문교육으로 전환한데 반해, 미국대학은 교양교육에서 자유교육 정신을 고수하면서 전문교육은 전문대학원에서 행하는 대학교육의 구조를 유지하고 있기 때문이다. 셋째, 본 연구는 대학의 교양교육의 분석을 통해서 미적소양 교육이 시각적 문해력을 향상시키는 능력을 함양하고 학습자가 처한 세계를 비평적 관점에서 바라볼 수 있는 시민을 양성할 수 있는 중요한 영역임을 주장하고, 미적소양 교육에서 타 분야와의 학제간 접근, 체험교육의 확대, 주제중심의 탐구 방법 등이 시각적 문해력을 함양할 수 있도록 미적소양교육을 재개념화한다. 본 연구에서 논의하는 미적소양교육은 미술을 전공하지 않는 학생들을 대상으로 연구의 범위를 한정하였다. 따라서 대학교육에서 미적소양교육이 시각적 문해력을 향상시키는 가치를 발굴하고, 학습자가 비평적 관점으로 세계를 바라볼 수 있는 시민으로 성장할 수 있도록 대학의 교육적 기능에 관해 조명했다는 점에서 본 연구의 중요성이 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-0440			KJD:ART001441753		J	Kang, Inae								A Brief Review on the Connected Relationship between Virtual Museums and Visual Culture Art Education			가상박물관(Virtual Museum)과 시각문화미술교육의 통합적 접목에 대한 소고					ART EDUCATION REVIEW	조형교육			37				1	29							2010	2010	As the 21st century requires the radical and wholistic paradigm shift in terms of curriculum, pedagogy, and learning theories in every academic field, so the art education has come to the terms with ‘visual culture art education(VCAE)' as a new approach, which represents postmodern theorizing, encompassing both popular and fine arts, emphasizing visual literacy to the ‘empowered' learner for the critical interpretation and criticism on the meaning of images in terms of their own cultural predispositions. This study, after analyzing and connecting VCAE with constructivist principles of instruction which are also regarded as embodying the postmodern educational approaches and values in education, analyzed the educational potentials of virtual museums(or galleries) for the purpose of seeking for the theoretical link with VCAE. For that purpose, several internationally reputed virtual galleries were examined within three representative features of digital archive, personalization, and online community in the virtual museum. Finally this paper pinponted the interconnected relationships of how the educational values of the virtual museum can be applied for the practice and theory of VCAE.				시각문화 중심의 학습활동을 안심하고 신뢰하며 실천해갈 수 있는 학습도구이자 학습공간으로서 ‘가상박물관’의 활용을 고려해볼 수 있다. 가상박물관에서 제공하는 다양한 이미지, 자료, 정보는 교과서에서 제공하는 제한적 정보와 자료를 넘어서 질적 또는 양적으로도 비교할 수 없을 만큼 풍부하고 전문적인 지식을 제공하게 될 것이며, 일반 검색엔진에서 볼 수 있는 검증되지 않은 자료들의 위험성으로부터 학생들을 보호해줄 수 있기 때문이다. 또한 가상박물관에서 제공하는 온라인 학습커뮤니티는 학생들의 학습결과를 교실이나 학교에 국한시키지 않고 외부와 공개적으로 공유, 소통할 수 있는 공간을 마련해줄 수 있기 때문이다.물론 본고에서 제시한 국외 가상박물관의 상황과 비교하여 우리나라 가상박물관의 상황은 실지로 미술수업시간에 적용하기에는 매우 부족하다. 그러나 먼저 외국의 가상박물관에서 이루어지는 다양한 교육환경을 이해하고 경험해봄으로써, 우리의 교실수업에 적합한 현지화 작업도 좀더 효과적으로 빠른 시간 내에 이루어질 수 있을 것이다. 또한 미술교육에서 다루는 대상이 문자 위주가 아니라 시각적(물론 다른 감각적 기능도 포함하지만) 이미지이기 때문에, 그것은 언어의 한계를 다소 뛰어넘을 수 있는 여지를 담고 있다. 따라서 국내 가상박물관이 외국의 수준에 이르기를 기다리기보다는, 우선적으로 외국 가상박물관에서 제공하는 풍부한 디지털 아카이브를 수업에서 활용하여, 교과서에서 제시되는 사진으로서의 작품보다는 훨씬 질적으로 우수한 디지털 이미지로서 사용해봐야 할 것이다. 또한 외국 가상박물관에서 제시하는 우수한 교수지도안을 참고하여, 제한적이나마 국내 가상박물관에 있는 디지털 이미지나 자료를 활용한 창의적인 수업지도안을 만들어보는 것도 제안해본다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-4177			KJD:ART001468209		S	Portugal, Cristina; Ribeiro, Flavia; Couto, Rita						Chova, LG; Belenguer, DM; Torres, IC		IMAGE AS A LANGUAGE LEARNING INNOVATION								EDULEARN10: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES		EDULEARN Proceedings														2010	2010	This study has as a main question witch is the role of the image in the knowledge construction.

Research into the visual cultural elements will give direction to the promotion of educational and social development.While previous research proceeded from the visual cultural education positions of the Visual Cultural Art Education(VCAE) theory and the Discipline Base Art Education(DBAE) paradigm, this study will seek to identify the beneficial elements and the positive and negative influences of visual culture contents. Through the interpretation of the background of forming visual culture and the adjustment of visual culture contents more effective applications of visual culture can be established.Research into visual cultural elements can provide the motivation to improve the effectiveness and productivity of culture-based industries in local venues. The examination of specific materials and their use at visual culture contents can identify applicable educational features and the benefits to be derived from their implementation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-0936			KJD:ART001506331		J	Joh, Yunsook								A Study of the Characters and functions of Photoon(Photo-Cartoon) as Public  Expressive Media			대중적 표현매체로서의 포툰의 매체적 특성 및 기능에 관한 연구					Journal of Digital Design	디지털디자인학연구			10	1			183	192							2010	2010	The advent of Internet has affected how to divide and define each art form by merging or intertwining one with the other or more.This trend is accelerated by the digital generation,geared by the strength in digital tools and visual literacy. They actively express themselves through their own individual art form and display and share it in Internet space.In this new digital environment, one of most arising new public art form is Photoon(Photo-Cartoon).Photoon is a new media that combines the characteristics of photography and cartoon. With the help of digital tools such as digital camera,photoon has recently greatly grown in volume among other user created contents(UCC). Although it used to be considered as an experimental approach in cartoon making methods in the past,Photoon has become one of the most popular expressive media in web over last few years.Therefore, the study of Photoon is a meaningful approach to renewing the traditional characteristics and functions of photography and cartoon. In addition, it is an attempt to search as much potential of Photoon as possible as artistic and social media				인터넷을 포함한 디지털 환경의 도래는 각 예술형식 간의 경계를 무너뜨리고. 자유로운 매체 간 교류와 융합을가능하게 한다.이것은 또 인터넷 검색과 디지털 기기에 익숙하고 시각적 리터러시(Visual Literacy)에 강한 디지털 세대의 출현에 의해 더욱 가속화되고 있다. 이들은 개인적인 표현매체의 활용과 그 공개에 더욱 적극적이며 기존미디어에 대해서도 단지 수동적으로 소비하는데 그치지 않고그것을 원료로 삼아 이차적 생산을 하는 생비자로서 활동한다.이러한 사회적 문화적 변화를 반영하는 표현형식 중에서 현재 웹상에서 가장 적극적으로 수용되고 활용되고있는 예술형식은 단연 사진과 만화이다. 사진과 만화는제작과 응용이 상대적으로 편리하고 메시지 전달의 효과 또한 즉각적이다. 이를 증명하듯 사진과 만화는 활발한 상호 융합을 통해 ‘포토카툰(Photo-Cartoon)’, 소위‘포툰(photoon)’이란 가장 대중적인 표현매체 중 하나로서 자리매김하고 있다. 과거에는 기존 만화의 형식적 실험 중 하나에 불과했지만 최근에 와서는 주목할 만한양적인 증가와 함께 그 기능과 역할 또한 확장되고 있는 것이다.따라서 포툰에 대한 연구는 기존의 만화나 사진이 가지고 있던 매체적 특성을 새롭게 발견하고 확장시키는 시도인 동시에, 포툰의 고유한 매체적 특성속에 잠재하고있는 예술적 가능성 및 사회적 함의까지를 예단할 수있는 의미 있는 작업이라 하겠다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-2319			KJD:ART001415607		J	Purchase, Sharon; Lowe, Sid; Ellis, Nick					Purchase, Sharon/0000-0003-2596-8731			From "taking" network pictures to "making" network pictures A new metaphorical manifesto for industrial marketing research								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT				23	5	SI		595	615		10.1108/09534811011071306					2010	2010	Purpose - An earlier researcher, Wood, proposed that cinema is the most appropriate metaphor for interpretation of contemporary life and organizations. The paper adopts the enthusiasm for the cinema metaphor and explores the implications for industrial marketing and business networks, with particular reference to the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group researchDesign/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the Cartesian picture theory of the early Wittgenstein, the comparable "pictures agenda" within the IMP, then the post-Cartesian "language gaming" approach adopted by the later Wittgenstein, and associates it with an agenda to introduce a more "cinematographic" approach, introducing issues within the "linguistic turn" to the study of business networks.Findings - The transformation of the contemporary "post-Cartesian" culture from "written" to "visual" was not fully appreciated until the invention and mass appeal of cinema and the concomitants of a visual culture became more apparent In the notion of the "spectacle", Debord was amongst the first to show that the postmodern visual culture was one where social relations are dominated by commodified images The images that prevail, from this critical viewpoint, are "social opiates" masquerading as progress that control actors through addictive consumption and acquisition by spectator consumers In this context, business to business relationships are about how these image-based addictions are maintained within business cultures.Research limitations/implications - The adoption of a cinematographic metaphor would appear to be a pertinent development for understanding of business network relationshipsOriginality/value - The advantage of a cinematographic metaphor over other, less visual, metaphors is that cinema is more visually sophisticated and entirely embedded in cultures dominated by commodified images It is appropriate, therefore, that visual literacy, realities as increasingly "image-dominated" and "virtual" business networks are better understood through the lens of a cinematographic metaphor									14	0	0	0	0	14			0953-4814			WOS:000283344500009		J	jagodzinski, jan; 최옥희								Revisiting Visual Culture in Art Education: What’s Right and What’s Wrong with It?								Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			11	1			1	29							2010	2010	My presentation attempts to revisit visual cultural art education (VCAE) within the context of designer capitalism. I worry that teachers are not addressing youth fantasies that constitute their popular culture. My own involvement in visual culture since the 1980s through the Social Theory Caucus indicates that it is the digitalized world of the "frameless image" that is of high concern. I maintain that visual culture art education as it is currently theorized in art education is caught by the limitations of representation. Visual literacy is generally a structualizt endeavor. To move beyond this position requires that art educators necessarily recognize the affective intensity that underlies meaning making. What contemporary art can "do" and the structuring forces of bodily affect in popular culture are both required for art education in the 21st century. I draw on the ethico-political philosophy of Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari to make my case.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART001408726		J	LEE, JAE-YOUNG								Technology in Art Education for Critical Pedagogy			미술교육과 테크놀로지: 비평적 교수법을 위하여					Journal of Research in Art Education	미술과 교육			11	1			31	50							2010	2010	This study discussed the ways in which to incorporate technologies into art education. Critical pedagogythe intersection of one of the main claims of visual culture art education and critical social theory in art educationwas the lens used to discuss the educational purposes and functions of technologies in art education. This paper first examined the limits of previous usages of technologies in the field of art education; it then delved into the function of contemporary technologies and the benefits of using them in art classes. Beyond these foundational analyses, this paper examined three educational implications of critical pedagogy for art education: (1) the need to develop critical consciousness through students’ self-reflective inquiry; (2) the need to facilitate students’ critical self-reflection through social networking such as dialogue, communication, and interaction; and (3) the need for empowerment in order to stimulate students’ participation in social transformation. The final section of this paper focused on how to incorporate technologies into art education in order to achieve the three educational implications. This interdisciplinary work bridging art, technology, and critical pedagogy closely navigated how to use technologies for instruction in terms of more efficient instructional materials, instructional contents, and alternative instructional strategies. It also investigated the effective usage of technologies to facilitate students’ learning. Based on recent scholarly research about technologies in art education, the last part of this paper searched for theoretical conceptualization of practical integrations of technologies into art education. Therefore, more practical research following this paper may expand this theoretical investigation and propose new horizons of technologies in art education for critical pedagogy.				본 연구는 미술과 테크놀로지 활용 방향과 방법을 비평적 교수법이라는 관점에서 논의한다. 논의를 이끌어내기 위해 먼저 기존의 테크놀로지를 활용한 미술교육의 한계와 함께 테크놀로지의 새로운 기능성을 이용한 테크놀로지 활용 미술교육의 이점을 살펴본다. 다음으로 비평적 교수법이 추구하는 미술교육의 방향 세 가지를 논의한다: (1) 자아 반성적 탐구를 통한 비평적 의식 개발, (2) 대화와 의사소통을 활성화시키는 사회적 네트워킹과 자아에 대한 반성적 이해 증진, 그리고 (3) 미술을 통한 사회 참여를 북돋우는 비평적 역량 강화. 이러한 논의의 토대 위에 학생들의 비평적 의식을 개선하고 역량 강화를 성취하기 위한 대안적인 미술과 테크놀로지 활용 방향과 방안을 마지막으로 살펴본다. 구체적으로 교사들의 수업을 지원하기 위한 테크놀로지 활용 방안으로 (1) 교수 자료 제작 지원, (2) 교수 내용의 확장, 그리고 (3) 교수 도구의 확장이라는 관점을 검토한다. 그리고 기존의 미술과 테크놀로지 활용 논문들에 소개된 아이디어를 중심으로 학생들의 학습을 지원하는 테크놀로지 활용 방안을 비평적 교수법이라는 관점에서 이론적으로 논의한다. 따라서 후속되는 실천적 사례연구들이 본 연구가 제기하는 이론적 논의를 확장시킬 뿐만 아니라 기존 테크놀로지 활용 미술 수업의 한계성을 넘어 보다 구체적이고 대안적인 비전을 제시해 주리라 예상된다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-747X			KJD:ART001408731		S	Gingchi, Yu L.; Chao, Shih-Fann; Yang, Hung-Jen						Mastorakis, N; Mladenov, V; Bojkovic, Z		Visual Language and Converging Technology								NEW ASPECTS OF APPLIED INFORMATICS, BIOMEDICAL ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATICS AND COMMUNICATION		International Conference on Applied Informatics and Communications-International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Biomedical Informatics						317	+							2010	2010	Knowledge of graphic design, information design, visual communication, visual language, and visual literacy might be important for our ability to better produce effective messages "messages that really work".

Photography education for children includes several aspects, such as appreciate of photographs, acquisition of artistic, and technical,scientifical and aesthetic characteristics. Thus photography education covers both experiential activities of objects and studies of conceptual images. The main issue of this thesis is LTP(Literacy Through Photography) originated from the United States of America. LTP is mainly focused on appreciation of photograph, expression through photograph, and writing about the content of photograph taken by children. The purpose of this thesis is not only to introduce the general things, the history, the goal and curricula of the LTP program but also to analyze the content and effect of LTP from the aspect of "Photography Pedagogy".

A survey of visual resources professionals was conducted to gather opinions on status, recruitment, training and skills needed in the visual resources field.Analysis. Two sets of the categories were employed for content analysis. The first category was the information environments within which the jobs existed. The sub-categories that emerged were academic, archives, museums, library and private information environments. The second category was for specifying the qualifying requirements for the jobs. The sub-categories included academic background, experience and skills and knowledge.Results. Image processing, digital imaging, visual literacy, communication, data asset management and cataloguing emerged as desired skill areas.Conclusion. Visual resources is an emerging, increasingly complex field experiencing the impact of digital technologies and the many environments of practice. These include museums, archives, private organizations and libraries.

As a reflection of this, a new learning domain, named "visual reading and presentation" was added to Primary School First Level Turkish Curriculum in 2005-2006 educational year. It is expected that this new learning domain will prepare students better for the 21(st) century which seems to be full of images of all sorts.The aim of this study is to determine the efficiency of visual reading and presentation learning domain in application in Turkish classes, based on the views of teachers. For this purpose, a survey was conducted on 550 classroom teachers. Findings obtained from the analyses of the data can be summarized as follows: it is determined in the study that teachers generally welcome learning domain of visual reading and presentation with an exception of a few objectives and they think that it is efficient in application. Furthermore, teachers think that learning domain of visual reading and presentation has positive effects on learning. However, according to teachers, schools lack the necessary materials to fulfill the requirements of this domain.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1300-1337			WOS:000270891200004		J	Buck-Morss, Susan; Espinosa, Juan Manuel								ESTUDIOS VISUALES E IMAGINACIÓN GLOBAL								Antipoda.

Also, art education needs to present the systematic standard for producing and analyzing visual images in visual culture studies. Thus, the purpose of this study is to present pedagogy that enables students to interpret the texts of advertising pictures in order that they may cope with visual effect-centered culture critically, introspectively and actively. In order to do so, a critico-pedagogy was developed on the basis of the analysis framework for pictorial texts and it was applied to the actual spot. The following is an expectable effect in this study. The test group, to which the pictorial text analysis-based critico-pedagogy against commercial advertisements was applied, will enhance their artistic knowledge, the uptake of art, appreciative power and expressive ability more than the control group to which normal pedagogy was applied. In result, such results will have an effect on the scholastic performance measured by the practical test and the formative test. The results of this study came out as in the following: pictorial text analysis-based critico-pedagogy against commercial advertisements was more effective to enhance the scholastic performance of learners, as compared to traditional pedagogy. Accordingly, the pedagogy presented in this study is expected to positively enable students to interpret pictorial texts dispassionately on the premise that the goal of education in visual art is to enhance cognition and criticism on various visual images.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-4177			KJD:ART001366822		J	LEE, Junghee; Kim, Sunah								A Study on Visual Communication Based on Semiotical Analysis - Focused on the Mobile Design -			기호학적 분석에 기초한 시각커뮤니케이션 연구 - 모바일 디자인 사례를 중심으로 -					ART EDUCATION REVIEW	조형교육			33				459	484							2009	2009	Visual culture that reflects environments of a learner is covered by design education within an art curriculum and the domain of design education is widening as multi-orientation in visual culture related phenomena becomes diversified. However, the domain of design education within a curriculum where visual cultures are reflected, tends to be limited to providing simple resources such as providing basic knowledge, etc., and shows its limitations in providing frameworks on its ideology which serves as guideline for building sense of appreciation and understanding. In this study, the researcher has focused on the communications exchanged within the realm of visual culture and proposed segmentation on classifications and elements which serve as basis for judgments made by an observer, so that the study may help learners to improve their critical reasoning by building objective and systematic understandings in approaching the visual culture.Communications are conducted in a culture through diversified media. Moreover, such communications as visual communications based on semiotical analysis put emphasis on transmitting respective meanings through procedural, cultural and grammatical symbols, and storing and extracting social, psychological and visual meaning innate in elements. Such symbols as social and psychological elements have their base in national and social consciousness. In addition, an identical symbol may be recognized otherwise, depending on the perspective of the observer, following changes in social, economical and cultural environments. As meaning and value of a visual symbol change depending on the background on creation of such visual image, or recognition at the time of observation, thus it is crucial to make judgments by basing on the social and cultural significance and value, not by basing on the meaning of the visual image itself alone. In this study, the researcher has taken procedural, cultural and grammatical approaches in conducting semiotical analysis on the visual communication proposed by the study and provided an objective and segmented index that can be used to understand and interpret visual images. Moreover, the researcher has conducted a case study on mobile phone, which is a product that is the most closely related to living environment, and extended its domain from a simple visual image medium to complex media comprised of diversified visual image transmission procedures and cultural environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-4177			KJD:ART001335070		J	Mun, Mi-Sun								Visual Literacy und Linguistische Filmanalyse im Deutschunterricht			시각 리터러시와 언어학적 영화분석교육					Deutsche Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft	독일어문학			17	2			251	272							2009	2009	Vorliegende Arbeit hat zum Ziel, padagogische Beispiele zur Ausbildung der ‘Visuellen Kompetenz’, bei denen die Filmanalysen linguisitisch angelegt sind, nachzuweisen und vorzuschlagen.Visual Literacy grundet sich darauf, dass Bilder gelesen werden konnen und dass wahrend des Lese- und Verstehensprozesses deren Sinn, hier das Image, ubermittelt werden kann. Visual Literacy bedeutet also eine kommunikative Kompetenz, die das in der Form des Images entstandene Wissen auswerten und vermitteln kann.Die Bewegung der Visual Literacy in Deutschland tritt am Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts - wie die Entwicklungsformen in den USA - eingeschrankt auf Fachbereiche wie die Kommunikations- und Medienwissenschaften in Erscheinung. Heutzutage breitet sich jedoch die ‘Visual-Literacy-Debate’ uber diese Wissenschaftsbereiche hinaus aus. Es hat sich Interesse daran entwickelt, wie das Verstehen und die Analyse des Images und dessen kreative Anwendung im Unterricht vermittelt werden kann. Insbesondere die Entwicklung der Lehrplane, zu deren Themen die Filme als wichtige Medien im Mittelpunkt stehen, und die padagogische Praxis, die sich systematisch ausfuhren lasst, werden somit immer breiter diskutiert.In Korea lasst sich die wissenschaftliche Debatte uber die Visual Literacy noch nicht ausmachen. Deren Projekt fur die Entwicklung der Lehrplane ist bis heute noch nicht entstanden und durchgefuhrt. Wenn im Unterricht uberhaupt die visuellen Medien eingesetzt weren, dann verwendet man sie meistens als Hilfsmittel zum schnellen Verstehen der Print Literacy. Auch bei den universitaren Lehrplanen, die den Film thematisieren, handelt es sich in Wirklichkeit um den Vergleich zwischen Literatur und deren Verfilmung. Die visuellen Medien wirken hier also nur als VergleichsmaSSstab.Wenn aber Visual Literacy die Fahigkeit bedeutet, Bilder - zur Ubermittelung des Images - lesen, verstehen und anwenden zu konnen, und wenn man mit der Einsicht einverstanden ist, dass diese Fahigkeit in dem systemtischen padagogischen Lernprozess zu erwerben ist, so scheint es an der Zeit zu sein, dass auch bei uns die Debatte uber die praktischen Lehrplane der Visual Literacy gefuhrt wird. Vor allem soll sich das Einfuhrungsseminar uber die Visual Literacy wie <Wie analysiere ich einen Film?> - wie die Lernprozesse um Erwerb einer Fremdsprache - damit befassen, die filmischen Komponenten und den in deren Zusammenhang entstehenden Sinn aufzuzeigen. Dieses Vorgehen, bei dem die filmischen Komponenten zur Herstellung des Sinnes umkomponiert werden, soll das Einfuhrungsseminar also beinhalten.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-1560			KJD:ART001359196		J	장상근								A Study on Visual Literacy in the Text of Parody Advertising			비주얼 리터러시를 통한 패러디 광고의 텍스트에 대한 고찰					Journal of Korean Society of Communication Design	정보디자인학연구			12	1			137	148							2009	2009	The advertising has great influence on the mass of public by mass media, and is an effective communicator. At this moment, the advertising effects of traditional media are losing their position as an advertising media and great influencer on the consumers, due to various new media. And trends of consumers tend to seek satisfaction of self-interest. As the result of these trends, advertising in the traditional media were disregarded by consumers. For solving these problems, The parody advertisement used to the advertising to improve effects. The method of parody is applied to psychology of human, which most people are influenced by special situations, which are familiar with his experiences. The purpose of this study analized text of parody in advertising, visual literacy of parody advertisement, and communication effects of text of parody in advertising.This study also suggested the guideline of parody as a new advertising method by analyzing case studies.				광고는 대중매체를 사용하여 전파하는 힘과 사회적 영향력이 매우 크다. 오늘날 다양한 뉴미디어의 등장으로 기존의 광고매체들이 힘을 잃어가고 있다. 소비자의 개인성향이 짙어지면서 자신들이 원하는 것만 찾게 되는 개인적인 소비풍조가 증가했다. 그 결과 기존 매체들의 광고는  소비자들에게 외면을 받고 있다. 이에 광고표현의 한 형태로서 패러디라는 장르가 나타나게 되었다. 광고에서 이 패러디 기법을 사용하게 되는 주된 이유는 인간의 심리와 연관되어 있다. 일반적으로 대부분의 인간은 자기에게 익숙한 것이 오래 기억되고 손이 가기 마련이다. 본 논문의 목적은 광고에서 나타나는 패러디를 텍스트의 분석과 그것을 토대로 하는 패러디 광고의 비주얼 리터러시의 연구와 더불어 텍스트가 전달하고자 하는 커뮤니케이션에 대해 알아보고, 광고 사례를 연구함으로서 패러디가 올바른 광고문화로서 인식될 수 있는 기준을 제시하고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			2092-9633			KJD:ART001421327		J	SEI, LEE HWA; 권효정								A Study on the Expression Style of Web Visual Literacy for Effective Information Contents Design   -Focused on the Design of Library Literacy Contents-			효과적인 정보콘텐츠 설계를 위한 웹비주얼 리터러시의 표현원리에 관한 연구 - 라이브러리 리터러시 콘텐츠의 디자인을 중심으로 -					Journal of the Korean Society of Design Culture	한국디자인문화학회지			15	2			36	49							2009	2009	Today, Users in Web 2.0 are required to interpret pictures, images, and interfaces on the web fully as an indiscriminate and imaginary space. They also must criticize transformed and processed graphic data. In this study, the Web Visual Literacy was defined as ability of acquiring and decoding various and complex web graphic data in web-based contents. In addition, this study analyzed its fundamentals and suggested a process of its expression; how to express effectively the web literacy suited to the environment of Web 2.0 contents. First, basic concepts and characteristics of the Literacy were investigated. In terms of visual communication, its value and practical application were also studied. Further, interfaces of Library Literacy Contents were collected and analyzed, based on foreign data with many traditional cases. With the results, the prototype of data literacy contents was produced. This study was to reconsider the expression of the visual literacy, meeting a sensitive web paradigm of Web 2.0 through a series of processes. For future studies, it is expected that more advanced web literacy contents will be developed diversely, based on the methodological type of design obtained from this study.				오늘날 웹2.0 사용자들은 무차별적인 가상의 이미지 공간인 웹에서 영상, 이미지, 인터페이스, 등을 제대로 해석할 수 있어야 할 뿐만 아니라 변형 가공된 그래픽 정보들을 비판할 수 있는 능력까지 요구되고 있다. 본 연구에서는 웹기반 콘텐츠에 포함된 다양하고 복합적인 웹 그래픽 정보의 올바른 습득과 해독 능력을 웹 비주얼 리터러시로 규정하고, 그에 대한 이론적 원리분석 및 표현 방식을 제안하는 과정을 진행하였다. 즉, 웹2.0 콘텐츠 환경에 적합한 효과적인 웹 그래픽 리터러시의 표현 방법론을 제안하기 위한 것이다.   우선 웹 비주얼 리터러시의 기본적 개념과 특성에 관하여 조사 분석하였으며 비주얼 커뮤니케이션 측면에서의 가치와 활용에 관하여 고찰하였다. 또한, 전통적 사례가 풍부한 외국 데이터를 기반으로 라이브러리 리터러시 콘텐츠들의 인터페이스를 수집하여 분석하고 그 결과를 바탕으로 정보 리터러시 콘텐츠 프로토타입 제작 과정을 진행하였다. 일련의 연구 과정을 통해 웹 2.0 시대의 감성 웹 패러다임에 맞는 비주얼 리터러시의 표현 방식을 재조명하고자 한다.   향후, 본 연구를 통해 얻어진 방법론적 설계 형식과 데이터들을 기반으로 보다 진보된 형태의 웹 리터러시 콘텐츠 개발이 다각적으로 발전하기를 기대한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-6497			KJD:ART001351024		J	Harrow, Alison; Wells, Mary; Humphris, Gerry; Taylor, Cara; Williams, Brian				Williams, Brian/G-5736-2012	Williams, Brian/0000-0003-0000-4354; Wells, Mary/0000-0001-5789-2773			"Seeing is believing, and believing is seeing": An exploration of the meaning and impact of women's mental images of their breast cancer and their potential origins								PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING				73	2			339	346		10.1016/j.pec.2008.07.014					NOV 2008	2008	Objective: To explore the nature, meaning and perceived origin of women's mental images of their breast cancer.Methods: Fifteen women. who had completed treatment for primary breast cancer, participated in this qualitative in-depth interview Study. Data were analysed using a constant comparative technique within the "Framework" method.Results: Almost all women had a mental image of their cancer. Images reflected their beliefs about their illness (its appearance, character and dangerousness) and appeared to be related to a number of fears and concerns. The origin of images Was uncertain but appeared to be influenced by scan images, verbal metaphors presented by health professionals, and previous beliefs held about cancer. Some women used metaphors presented to infer properties of the cancer that may have been unintended by the health professional.Conclusion: Women may have mental images of their breast cancer that are associated with hope, reassurance, anxiety, despair, or views about the future. Further longitudinal research is required to establish the origin and importance of these images.Practice implications: Health professionals may find that exploring women's mental images of their cancer is a helpful way of identifying potential misunderstandings about their illness.

One method of enhancing inspection skills is teaching "visual literacy," the ability to reason physiology and pathophysiology from careful and unbiased observation.OBJECTIVE: To improve students' visual acumen through structured observation of artworks, understanding of fine arts concepts and applying these skills to patient care.DESIGN: Prospective, partially randomized pre- vs. post-course evaluation using mixed-methods data analysis.PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four pre-clinical student participants were compared to 34 classmates at a similar stage of training.INTERVENTION: Training the Eye: Improving the Art of Physical Diagnosis consists of eight paired sessions of art observation exercises with didactics that integrate fine arts concepts with physical diagnosis topics and an elective life drawing session.MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of accurate observations on a 1-h visual skills examination was used to evaluate pre- vs. post-course descriptions of patient photographs and art imagery. Content analysis was used to identify thematic categories. All assessments were blinded to study group and pre- vs. post-course evaluation.RESULTS: Following the course, class participants increased their total mean number of observations compared to controls (5.41 +/- 0.63 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.53, p < 0.0001) and had increased sophistication in their descriptions of artistic and clinical imagery. A 'dose-response' was found for those who attended eight or more sessions, compared to participants who attended seven or fewer sessions (6.31 + 0.81 and 2.76 + 1.2, respectively, p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary course improved participants' capacity to make accurate observations of art and physical findings.									83	0	0	9	2	85			0884-8734			WOS:000257489400018	18612730	J	Villa Orrego, Nora Helena								Propuesta de alfabetización visual para estudiantes de educación básica apoyada en recursos hipermediales: Un aporte a la comprensión lectora	Proposal for visual literacy based on hypermedia resources for elementary school students: A contribution for the reading comprehension							Revista Interamericana de Bibliotecología				31	1			207	225							2008-06	2008	Frequently, teachers invest a great deal of time in promoting the comprehension of verbal texts by students as a fundamental part of the teaching-learning process, and relegate the accompanying images to a second place. This attitude is associated to a traditional conception of reading comprehension, in spite of the fact that images occupy a salient place in current information sources and that in many occasions they carry information different to the verbal texts. This article presents the basic rationale over which studies regarding visual literacy were initiated and analyzes the impact of a proposal for visual literacy in reading comprehension. Finally, it describes the technical aspects that were taken into account in the elaboration of a hypermedia environment designed specifically with the purpose of favoring the reading of images in elementary school students.

Cultural climatology and the representation of sky, atmosphere, weather and climate in selected art works of Constable, Monet and Eliasson								GEOFORUM				39	2			570	580		10.1016/j.geoforum.2006.10.015					MAR 2008	2008	The visual turn presents new challenges and methodologies for the pursuit of geography as we seek to communicate our ideas and understanding within and beyond the discipline. This paper attempts to show the potential importance of visual culture within a field that we may call cultural climatology. Cultural climatology seeks to explore the dialectic between society and atmosphere, weather and climate at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A new visual approach to cultural climatology is presented as a possible way of stimulating conversations across the divide between the social and physical sciences. Images and visualisation assert their presence in the understanding, modelling and communication of many nature/culture debates, highlighting a need both for visual literacy across geography, and for social and physical scientists to share their visual methodologies. Cultural climatologists, like other scientists, need visual methodologies for both the critical construction and deconstruction of the images they wish to present and with which they are confronted. To illustrate the importance of visual literacy for cultural climatologists this paper introduces a sample of works from three artists: Constable, Monet and Eliasson. It shows how an exploration of their work (via a theory of pictures) could help to provide: firstly a methodology for understanding the cultural symbolism of skies and weather; secondly an assessment of the urban atmosphere in London at the turn of the 20th century and thirdly an example of the effective representation of atmosphere, weather and climate involving public participation and understanding. Lessons learned from deconstructing these works of art will then be used to suggest improvements in the visualisation of weather in the production and consumption of weather forecasts (thus, picturing theory).

Advances in technology fueled this shift. Students must learn to cope with and intelligently contribute to a culture rife with easy access to the visually rich Web, photo dependant social networks, video saturated media, and graphically sophisticated entertainment and gaming. To address this challenge, some educators are transforming their school districts' and institutions' core curricula to include visual literacy requirements and preparing themselves for this shift from text to image by learning how to teach using new forms of media. In addition, educators are providing opportunities for students to be successful consumers and producers of new media by teaching them to analyze and interpret and to create and compose visual images and messages. Students must also learn how to make ethical judgments about a visual message's accuracy, validity, and worth.									36	0	0	0	0	36			0040-5841			WOS:000255894100004		B	Northcut, Kathryn			IEEE					Assessment of Visual Artifacts in the Information Economy								2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION CONFERENCE								239	245							2008	2008	Assessment of technical visual representations poses challenges for professionals in both academic and non-academic settings. Recent research demonstrates the challenge faced by technical communicators who assume responsibility for visual communication with little or no formal training in design or related fields [1]. Because many people now responsible for oversight, editing, and production of visual communication are primarily verbal communicators, we tend to either ignore matters of design or superimpose linguistic evaluation strategies onto images. The alternative model suggested here pulls from the rich scholarship based on Gestalt, narrative, and semiotic theories to shape an assessment heuristic that encourages visual assessment based on some foundational tenets of visual literacy.

The image, in modern society, has an important aesthetic meaning not only associated with space but also with time. Visual literacy has crucial meaning not just in reading and writing of singe image, but also in arrangement of images in context with diachrony. The abstract animation has educational importance in fundamental movement by modernist artist related with temporal and kinetic image, art work with historical meaning, and as one of phenomena of modern visual art. The abstract animation excludes narrative and representative image with purpose, creates pure movement of form and color temporally, and creates artistic and emotional images by doing these. At the same time, the abstract animation is synthetic education with musical music along with the tradition from Kandinsky. Also, the abstract animation has deep relation with aesthetic experience of visual culture, which focuses on voluptuous visual images excluding narrative.

Their artistic work takes on the aspect of cultural practice as the mirror of visual culture. Documentary images must be considered as a sign which indicates an extended role of media in our society. And also they indicate an increased visual literacy on the part of image makers such as artists, photographers and film makers as well as viewers. The artists mentioned here differ in degree to which reflection on the documentary tradition in their work. Nevertheless, what is common in their work is that they analyze and comment on the structure and effect of documentary images in the mass media. This testifies to an increased visual literacy among artists and also makes an appeal for it. The discussion about documentary in an art context should take visual literacy as a starting point. Our visual culture has adopted the vocabulary of documentary. Documentary which functions as mirror of visual culture can be considered as a cultural practice and has provided many possibilities of reflecting the word around us. The consideration of documentary in art context makes possible to evaluate the meaning and value of documentary photography and film.

According to Zizek, critics often blur the borderline between what a viewer sees on the screen and what the viewer invests with his/her libidinal investment in it in the form of hallucinatory supplements or distortions:In fact, Zizek argues that the shot of Madeleine's profile is totally subjectivized, depicting not what Scottie effectively sees but what he imagines, that is, his hallucinatory inner vision, and that this shot of the profile of Madeleine lets us encounter the "kino-eye" which functions as the "organ-without-body," the camera as a partial object, as an "eye" torn from the subject and freely thrown around. As Zizek perceives, in our daily lives, we encounter the uncanny moments when we catch sight of our own image which is not looking back at us. In other words, our specular image is torn away from us and our look is no longer looking at ourselves. Zizek's insightful comments is based upon his assumption that "what we see on the screen is the result of well-crafted tricks." Then, why this imaginary distortions and hallucinatory supplements? In fact, Zizek's Lacanian interpretation is insufficient to elaborate the split between the eye and the gaze, the split which is central in the discussion of the drive in relation to desire, subject, and the unconscious manifested in the scopic field. I would argue that one needs a certain elaborate schemata or interpretive topology from which one can visualize what one attempts to say. Gaze in terms of anamorphosis, visual literacy, and the schema of the hoop net is a candidate for such topology, and the modus operandi comes from the concept of transgression. My contention is that if one read Vertigo in terms of what Lacan says rather than what Zizek interprets in a Lacanian perspective, one can encounter a richer version of the analysis of the film under discussion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-666X			KJD:ART001301478		J	안성혜								Strategic Planning for Initiating Local Cultural Festivals			지역문화축제 활성화를 위한 전략적 기획 방안의 모색					The Journal of the Korea Contents Association	한국콘텐츠학회 논문지			8	12			168	175							2008	2008	As the travel industry grows and becomes increasingly more competitive, municipal governments have undertaken great efforts to maximize limited resources and develop their local economies by initiating and developing cultural festivals. Such festivals and events have become an efficient mechanism to enhance their image, increase tourism, and ultimately, stimulate their economy. However, marketing efforts to scale globally typically falter due to various factors: lack of originality, poor quality of contents, and a scarcity of competitive power. Hence, I wish to propose a model for developing cultural semiology and visual literacy, with storytelling utilized as a means of strategically illustrating local cultural festival contents. Subsequently, it is expected that such a model can underpin the importance of developing coherent edutainment content while illustrating the true meaning/value of local festivals.				지방자치시대가 개막된 이래 지방정부들은 바람직한 지역경제발전의 수단으로서, 한정된 자원으로 최대의 효과를 노리기 위해 내 고장 마케팅과 지역축제 활성화에 많은 노력을 기울이고 있다. 지역문화축제는 무형의 관광자원으로서 지역 활성화와 지역이미지 개선의 효율적인 수단이 되며, 문화관련 상품의 개발과 문화이벤트 등을 통해 지역소득증대에 기여하는 무한한 잠재력이 있기 때문이다. 그러나 현재의 지역문화축제는 독창성의 부재와 콘텐츠의 빈약 등 질적인 측면에서의 경쟁력 부재로 인해 그 잠재력을 세계화하지 못하고 있다. 본 논문은 지역문화에 기반한 독창성있는 축제 콘텐츠를 기획하기 위한 전략적 방안으로서 문화기호학의 의미생성모델과 스토리텔링을 통한 비주얼 리터러시를 제안하고자 하며, 이는 에듀테인먼트로서 축제의 의미와 그 기능을 확장해 보고자 하는 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-4877			KJD:ART001305333		J	Griffin, Michael								Visual competence and media literacy: can one exist without the other?								VISUAL STUDIES				23	2			113	129		10.1080/14725860802276255					2008	2008	In the last 20 years the notion that images overpower words, and the belief that a decreasing lexical literacy among the young has been offset by an increasing visual literacy, has been repeated often enough to become accepted wisdom. Yet the precise nature of visual literacy among the young and the relationship between visual competencies and the notion of media literacy have not been fully explored or adequately specified. Concepts of visual literacy and media literacy are unproductively conflated, and visual competencies are too often assumed on the part of those that exhibit familiarity with media culture. This essay compares and analyses notions of visual competence and media literacy and argues that: (1) a cultivated awareness of the production of visual forms and characteristics, and their implications, is necessary for what has been described in the literature as 'media literacy'; and (2) the acquisition of visual analysis skills pre-requires a broader operational context of media literacy. Through an examination of images from religious painting to news coverage the article argues that visual competencies and media literacy skills may, indeed, be mutually dependent.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1472-586X			WOS:000265696800002		J	Oliveira, Sara								Explorando o texto visual em sala de aula	Exploring visual text in the classroom							Trabalhos em Linguística Aplicada				46	2			181	197		10.1590/s0103-18132007000200004					2007-12	2007	Choices are ideologically constructed. Images are fruit of choices. Therefore, images are an ideological way to represent both the world around us and the intentions of those who produce them. What learning situations should we create that could work as effective counter-strategies to keep our students´ own choices as independent and unbiased as possible in the daily ideological bombing they are submitted by media and hypermedia in the contemporary society? The purpose of this paper is to explore the new literacies that could provide students with the necessary skills to understand and generate visual texts. In order to do that we discuss the concept of visual literacy and what semiotic resources are used to the production and strengthening of social relations. The theoretical foundation is based on Kress and van Leeuwen´s social semiotics, whose insights orient the news photo analysis accomplished in the last section of this work.		Escolhas são ideologicamente construídas. Imagens são fruto de escolhas. Portanto, as imagens são uma maneira ideologizada de representar tanto o mundo que nos cerca quanto as intenções daqueles que as produzem. Que situações de aprendizagem devemos oportunizar para nossos alunos, que funcionem como contra-estratégias eficazes às escolhas ideologizadas dos produtores midiáticos e hipermidiáticos de mensagens visuais da sociedade contemporânea? A proposta deste trabalho é explorar o viés dos novos letramentos, os quais incluem, dentre outras coisas, o desenvolvimento de habilidades para a compreensão e geração de textos visuais. Para tanto, discutimos o conceito de letramento visual e que recursos semióticos são utilizados no texto visual para a criação, estruturação e legitimação de relações sociais.

However, research has focused on commercials designed for child audiences. Also, whether advertising is commercially successful or not, it constitutes a 'form of acculturation'. However, research is mainly focused on perception of the commercial dimension of advertising, and does not treat advertisements as an integrated discourse. This paper investigates, through a semiological perspective, firstly the ability of a preschool child to perceive advertisements for adults as an integrated discourse (perception of the conative function of the images, perception of the metonymic function of the images, perception of the sender of the advertising message, etc.), and secondly the child's emotional involvement in this discourse. Our sample consists of 96 children, aged four to six from different kindergartens of Greece. Our findings are discussed on the basis of the goals of Media Education.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1350-293X			WOS:000257855900004		J	Dutrow, Barbara L.								Visual communication: Do you see what I see?								ELEMENTS				3	2			119	126		10.2113/gselements.3.2.119					APR 2007	2007	Visual displays of data, images of subatomic to planetary-scale features, and animations of geological processes are widely used to enrich our disciplines. However, their communicative power may be dramatically different to a student and to an expert because of the need for prior knowledge and inference when interpreting visuals. To "see" equivalent visual information, the non-expert must learn the visual language of the expert. Teaching visual literacy is important to instruction at all levels and is as fundamental to a discipline as its vocabulary. The underlying foundations of visual literacy and the recognition of what one "sees" and interprets in a visual depiction are critical for enhancing student learning and for effective communication in our visually rich discipline.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1811-5209			WOS:000245882500013		J	Yi, Sung-Do; 박상돈								Visual Literacy and its Art Educational Approach- Making and Implicating Documentary-Based Camera Phone Photographs -			비주얼 리터러시의 미술교육적 접근- 휴대폰 카메라를 이용한 다큐멘터리 사진의 제작과 활용을 중심으로 -					Art Education Research Review	미술교육논총			21	2			189	216							2007	2007	Today, visual culture has developed systematically, embracing a vast and various cultural spectrum with extensive categories. It has developed new categories that covers all traits not only as a media for only delivering information or getting information through visual cognition but as multiple media.The development of the image making mediums and the fast development of Internet use makes it possible to produce and share visual culture easily. Youth culture has taken a major role as an active producer as well as active consumer of visual cultures easily. They have been shown the powerful use of this medium by producing and using various visual culture tools .Visual culture in the digital age leads to a culture where students exist in a culture where they are exposed to and use visual images for communication.This has created an educational necessity for instruction in visual literacy. but visual literacy and visual culture have not been used as a curriculum actively in today’s art classes. therefore the main work that art education has to accomplish is to establish real curriculum which can increase visual literacy and also to look for educational uses for visual culture. so the ultimate purpose of this thesis is to find out a concrete educational method to increase visual literacy and the justifiability that visual culture education should be included in art classes. This is the lesson plan which consists of students using camera phones to take and use documentary photographs which we can utilize to discuss visual cultures and visual literacy. the medium to be used by the students is the camera phone due to its common usage and availability.				오늘날 시각문화는 문화의 다양한 스팩트럼과 광범위한 범주를 모두 아우르는 총체적 형태로 진화하고 있다. 시각적 인지를 통한 정보 전달과 수용이라는 단편성을 벗어나 복합 매체적 특징을 모두 아우르는 새로운 범주를 스스로 형성해 가고 있는 것이다. 이미지 저작 매체의 발달과 인터넷의 급속한 발달은 시각문화 생산과 공유의 대중화를 가져왔고 청소년들은 이러한 시각문화에 대한 가장 적극적인 수용자이자 다양한 시각문화를 생산하고 활용하는 매체적 역량을 보여주고 있다. 시각문화가 곧 문화로 직결되는 이러한 상황에서 비주얼 리터러시(visual literacy)에 대한 교육적 접근이 요구되고 있는 것이 현실이다. 하지만 현재의 미술교육은 시각문화와 비주얼 리터러시를 교실수업의 상황에 적극적으로 수용하지 못하고 있다. 따라서 미술교육의 당면 과제는 시각문화에 대한 교육적 방안을 모색하고 비주얼 리터러시를 신장시킬 수 있는 실제적 교육과정을 확립하는데 있다. 본고는 바로 이러한 문제의식을 바탕으로 시각문화 교육을 미술이라는 교과영역에서 수용해야 하는 당위성과 비주얼 리터러시의 신장을 위한 구체적인 교육 방법에 대해 모색하고자 한다. 청소년들의 삶 속에 일상화 되어있는 매체인 휴대폰 카메라를 활용하여 시각문화와 비주얼 리터러시를 논할 수 있는 다큐멘터리 사진을 제작하고 활용하는 수업방안의 예시가 바로 그것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-0440			KJD:ART001076827		J	임헌우								A Study on Emphasis of Image Using a Technique of Photo-Collage in Advertisements			광고에 있어서 포토콜라주 기법을 사용한 이미지 강조에 관한 연구					Journal of Digital Design	디지털디자인학연구			7	4			317	326							2007	2007	Today people live in a flood of visual image atthe so-caled age of competition for image.

In this study, we discuss the nature and importance of visualization in biochemistry education and argue that students should be explicitly taught visual literacy and the skills for using visualization tools as essential components of all biochemistry curricula. We suggest that, at present, very little pedagogical attention has been given to this vital component of biochemistry education, although a large diversity of static, dynamic, and multimedia visual displays continues to flood modern educational resources at an exponential rate. Based on selected research findings from other science education domains and our own research experience in biochemistry education, 10 fundamental guidelines are proposed for the promotion of visualization and visual literacy among students studying in the molecular and cellular biosciences.									76	1	0	4	2	77			1470-8175			WOS:000236031100006	21638645	J	Curran, Kevin; Casey, Michelle					Curran, Kevin/0000-0001-5237-5355			Expressing emotion in electronic mail								KYBERNETES				35	5-6			616	631		10.1108/03684920610662368					2006	2006	Purpose - Electronic mail (e-mail) and messaging systems are a powerful means of communication which are fast become a primary means of communication. This paper aims to describe the need for expression in e-mail.Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the need for expression in e-mail and the development of a personalised e-mail system. A survey is carried out to comprehend the derived meanings from visuals; as a result the prototype is formed.Findings - This paper presents a prototype which utilises the idea of reading pictures as sentences and the semiotic and linguistic meaning derived from those sentences. The system aims to interpret the sender's thoughts and convey their emotion and personality through a combination of graphical components, image, and expressive typography. In contrast with the new developing successful language that is rapidly spreading in the use of mobile devices, this personalized e-mail introduces a visual language that people will acquire in using their e-mails. Initial findings are presented from exercises of visual literacy, where the viewer has to play a series of matching games with words and images in order to derive each user's meanings and interpretations.Research limitations/implications - This interactive piece is attempting to transform the static nature of e-mail into a more dynamic form that can offer new ways to interpret verbal information visually. The device will instill the user's message with more authentic personalities and expressions.Practical implications - Cognitive semiotics is something designers explore over time with intuition and experience. Introducing and equipping young designers in college, with regard to semiotics would speed up this essential and unavoidable mental process.Originality/value - This research will accelerate the coming of emotion to computer systems. Graphic design should be viewed from a structuralism perspective as a language system, to extend the understanding of language from a spoken and written system of signs to a manner of visual signals. Designers play a part in reinventing and redefining signs and symbols.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0368-492X			WOS:000238997900002		J	ahn, sanghyuk								Correlation of Jacques Lacan's Mirror Stage and the process of Remediation on Image Media			쟈크 라캉의 거울단계와 영상미디어의 매개과정과의 연관성					Archives of Design Research	디자인학연구			18	4			147	154							2005	2005	In this paper, I am going to analyze a correlation of Jacques Lacan's Mirror Stage and the process of remediation on image media. It is because the remediation process of various digital media is letting people pass through one time of mirror stage again.Remediation for the Internet of traditional media, conflict with the virtual world and real world, identification that a virtual image changes a practical image is for it to be caused a remediation process by mutual link of various image media.The Narcissism which occurs in the relation a self with a idealized self searches a new own expression and forms a skillful mania culture. Reflexivity of active mania culture same as a Jacques Lacan's Mirror Stage is to be the possibility becoming the feature of media culture of today.However, if digital media culture generation spends extremely wasting time from the image media, these image media generations cannot grow into new future-type man.According to this, it is necessory to have a study on Visual Literacy that it is related to a Jacques Lacan's Mirror Stage.				다양한 미디어 환경으로 인한 이미지의 재매개화 과정은 디미털 미디어문화 세대에게 또 한번의 거울단계를 거치게 하고 있다고 보고, 라캉의 거울단계이론과의 연관성을 고찰하는데 연구의 목적이 있다.전통적인 매체가 인터넷으로의 재매개, 컴퓨터그래픽으로 인한 초실재적 환상의 재현으로 조성되는 가상세계와 실재세계와의 혼돈, 가상적 이미지가 선망의 대상으로 부각되며 실제적 이미지를 변화시키는 동일시 현상 등은 다양해지는 영상미디어의 상호 연계로 인한 재매개 기능으로 유발되는 것이다.주체와 이상화된 자아만의 관계인 2자적 관계에서 발생하는 타인이 배제된 '나르시스적' 동일성은 새로운 자기표현을 찾는데 능숙한 마니아 문화를 형성한다. 능동적인 마니아문화의 ‘자기반영성'(Reflexivity)은 현대 미디어 문화의 특징이 될 수 있는 것이다.그러나 디지털 미디어문화 세대가 자기 반영에 사로잡혀 타인이 배제된 나르시스즘에서 벗어나지 못한 채 이미지 은하계에서 소모적인 재미에 빠져 길을 잃는다면, 이러한 세대는 새로운 인간형으로 성장하지 못할 수도 있다. 이에 따라 거울단계와 연관된 ‘영상 리터러씨'(Visual Literacy)교육에 대한 체계적 연구를 필요케 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-8046			KJD:ART000976801		J	Jeong, HyeonSeon								Language, Text, Media and Culture : Four Categories for Multiliteracies Euducation			언어Â·텍스트Â·매체 Â·문화'범주와 '복합 문식성'개념을 통한미디어교육의 국어교육적 수용에 관한 연구					Jounal of Elementary Korean Education	한국초등국어교육			28				307	338							2005	2005	This article aims to propose a criteria for media education, particularly for the curriculum for Korean language education, based on a critical review of the current discussions. The four sub-categories of the criteria proposed here are Language, Text, Media and Culture. In this criteria, Language is defined as a system of signification beyond the limited notion of verbal language. This article also discusses the theory of multiliteracy and multimodality as core concepts for media education in literacy education in the age of multimedia.This article also critically examines some of the academic terms used in the field of Korean Language Education. Significantly, the terms, ‘mode’ and ‘media’ are introduced and the meaning of the terms such as ‘multiliteracy’ and ‘multimodality’ are clarified. Reviewing the recent qualitative research on children's multimodal texts, this article emphasizes that children can benefit from producing verbal-visual texts, either informational or aesthetic, in which multimodal and cross-modal meanings are made. It is argued that such production can provide a meaningful experience to reflect the ‘others' voices’ that are brought by children from their popular media experiences.				본고는 국어교육 내 미디어 교육 수용 방안에 대한 제반 논의를 비판적으로 검토하고, 이에 대한 대안으로서 ‘언어텍스트매체문화’ 범주 및 ‘복합 문식성’ 개념을 통한 매체 수용 방안을 제안하고 있다. 이는 현행 국어과 교육과정 내용에 대한 여섯 영역으로는 의사소통 능력의 신장이라는 국어교육의 목표에 부합하는 방식으로 매체를 수용하기 어렵다는 문제의식에서 출발한다. 본고는 ‘보기’와 ‘형상화’등 시각 언어 소통을 수용하기 위한 새로운 영역 설정이 필요함에 공감하지만, 현재로서는 시각언어와 문자 언어, 음성 언어 등이 복합적으로 작용하는 복합 문식성의 개념 설정이 우선되어야 함을 주장한다. 이러한 문제의식에서 본 연구는 국어교육 내 매체 수용에 있어 몇 가지 주요 개념들이 논의의 혼란을 초래하고 있다고 보고, 언어 양식과 매체, 복합 문식성과 복합 양상, 언어 자원과 문화 자원 등의 주요 개념들의 명료화 하는데 초점을 둔다. 이러한 개념의 논의는 복합 문식성 분야에서 이루어진 최근의 질적 연구 성과들을 검토하는 방식으로 이루어지는데, 이를 통해 궁극적으로 본고는 대화와 소통을 위한 미디어 교육 수용의 원칙을 수립하고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-8395			KJD:ART001161196		J	Kim, Kitai								The Comparative Study of Visual Literacy between Reading Disability Children and Normal Children			문자읽기와 영상읽기 능력비교를 통한 미디어교육 효과연구: 문자읽기 장애 여부가 영상읽기 능력에 미치는 영향을 중심으로					Journal of Communication Science	언론과학연구			5	3			35	62							2005	2005	This study was conducted to investigate the impact of reading disability on visual literacy and the relationship between the degree of reading disability and visual literacy. Children in same ages with similar intellectual ability were classified into two groups, which were a study group reading disability children and a control group (normal children). The comparison of reading ability and visual literacy between the two groups was done by using reading part of the reading diagnosis test. For the comparison of literacy between the two groups, the text of “TV Fairy Tale, the Happy World” was provided in the form of print media and visual media.A questionnaire sheet modified from the questions of reading diagnosis test was used for reading ability measurement. In the comparison of visual literacy between the two groups, there was statistically significant difference in the five out of six categories used; there was no significant difference in the visual estimation ability. In the correlation study of reading abiility and image literacy, there was statistically significant correlation in the letter emotional response and visual emotional response in the study group while there was statistically significant difference in the ability of memory and the degree of emotional response, and reading ability and visual literacy in the control group.

Moreover, it was found that there was partial correlation between reading and visual literacy.				본 논문은 미디어교육의 효과를 측정하기 위한 연구의 하나로서 문자읽기 장애 여부가 영상읽기 능력에도 영향을 미치는지를 중심으로 이루어졌다. 즉, 문자읽기 장애가 영상읽기에도 영향을 미치는지 그리고 문자읽기 장애 정도와 영상읽기 능력과는 어떤 상관관계가 있는지 알고자 하는 연구이다.  이를 위해 먼저 읽기장애 아동으로 판별된 집단과 같은 연령의 비슷한 지능을 가진 비교집단을 선정하였다.그리고 글을 읽고 의미를 이해하는데 어려움이 있는 독해장애 아동을 중심으로 읽기장애 아동집단을 선정하고 읽기진단 검사의 독해력 부분을 응응하여 문자매체읽기와 영상읽기(리터러시) 능력의 차이를 비교 분석하였다. 다음으로는 영상읽기 비교를 위해 아동들에게 친숙한 주제로 다가갈 수 있는 “TV동화 행복한 세상”의 텍스트를 문자매체와 영상매체의 형태로 나누어 제시하였다.문자읽기 측정방법으로는 읽기 진단검사에서 이용한 질문을 응용하여 각 문항 당 0점에서 5점까지의 점수를 배당하는 설문지를 만들어 사용하였다. 연구결과는 다음과 같다.읽기장애아동과 비장애아동과의 영상읽기 능력의 차이를 비교한 결과 모두 여섯 가지의 분석 항목중 영상추측 능력만 두 집단간 차이가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 즉, 읽기장애를 가진 어린이들이라도 영상으로 제시된 이야기의 맥락 아래에서 상황 및 의미를 추측하는 능력에 있어서는 비장애 아동들에 비해 결코 뒤떨어지지 않는다는 결론이다.  다음으로 문자읽기 능력과 영상읽기 능력과의 상관관계를 알아본 결과 장애아동의 경우, 역시 모두 여섯 가지의 분석 항목 중 문자감성 반응정도와 영상감성 반응정도는 통계적으로 유의미한 상관관계가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 한편 비장애아동의 경우는 여섯 가지의 분석 항목 중 기억능력과 감성 반응정도 그리고 행동 변화의지에 있어서 문자읽기 능력과 영상읽기 능력이 통계적으로 유의미한 상관관계가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 결론적으로 본 연구를 통해 문자읽기 장애아동이라고 해도 영상으로 이야기 줄거리를 이해하는 과정 즉, 상황 및 의미를 추측하는 능력에 있어서는 비장애아동에 비해 뒤떨어지지 않는다는 점을 발견하였다. 아울러 문자읽기 능력과 영상읽기 능력과는 부분적으로 상관관계가 있는 것으로 파악되었다.					0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-2653			KJD:ART000979110		B	Aanstoos, J			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY					Visual literacy: An overview								32ND APPLIED IMAGERY PATTERN RECOGNITION WORKSHOP, PROCEEDINGS								189	193							2004	2004	Visual literacy may be defined as the ability to recognize and understand ideas conveyed through visible actions or images, as well as to be able to convey ideas or messages through imagery. Based on the idea that visual images are a language, some authors consider visual literacy to be more of a metaphor, relating imagery interpretation to conventional literacy, than a well-defined and teachable skill. However, the field is credited with the development of educational programs that enhance students' abilities to interpret and create visual messages, as well as improvement of reading and writing skills through the use of visual imagery.This paper presents a broad overview of the concept of field literacy, focusing on its interdisciplinary nature and varied points of view.					32nd Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop32nd Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop	OCT 15-17, 2003OCT 15-17, 2003	IEEE Comp Soc, TC Pattern Anal & Machine IntelligenceIEEE Comp Soc, TC Pattern Anal & Machine Intelligence	Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					0-7695-2029-4	WOS:000221356000031		B	Levin, LM			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Johnson, Colin/H-1442-2012				Children's understanding of imagery in picture books								32ND APPLIED IMAGERY PATTERN RECOGNITION WORKSHOP, PROCEEDINGS								194	198							2004	2004	This discussion focuses on beginning readers' perceptions and observations of picture book images they encounter in both school and home literacy, environments.

Furthermore, effective visual communication is cross-cultural and exceeds linguistic boundaries, as well as being multidisciplinary. As such, it is important that engineers of the 21(st) Century develop visual literacy. Such communication can be achieved using icons, which should not be considered as replacement for text, but more adjunct to text. Drawings and diagrams should be clearly constructed so that they are not limited by cultural or linguistic boundaries. This can achieve improved efficiency plus heightened safety. Given this, it is important that there be a strong level of standardisation that is led by psychological and cognitive research into the best image in terms of instant recognition, rather than bureaucratic consensus or isolated design teams. Visualisation tools that can aid engineers include mental models and concept maps. Training in visual communication should incorporate the identification of cognitive junctions, which can aid in identifying the most effective symbol if multiple versions exist. Further substantial qualitative and quantitative research needs to be undertaken in this area.					4th Global Congress on Engineering Education4th Global Congress on Engineering Education	JUL 05-09, 2004JUL 05-09, 2004	UNESCO Int Ctr Engn EducUNESCO Int Ctr Engn Educ	Bangkok, THAILANDBangkok, THAILAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					0-7326-2257-3	WOS:000222988800068		J	Hoang, Younju								The moing image education as visual culture education			시각문화교육으로서 동영상교육					Journal of Art Education	미술교육연구논총			16	1			199	220							2004	2004										0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-1274			KJD:ART000936501		J	Stewart, WP; Floyd, MF								Visualizing leisure								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				36	4			445	460							2004	2004	This essay defines the visual approach through a review of leisure-related literature and draws insights from scholars across the social sciences. Visual leisure is the collection of several approaches to research that recognizes the relevance of vision to ways we make sense of leisure in our lives. It is not about more data or incremental advancement, but on providing a different kind of data that repositions research questions in ways that verbal or numeric information are not able to do. Visual leisure has tremendous potential to democratize research through an expanded accessibility of data, an enhanced transparency of argument, and an empowerment of lay people in research-based policy and planning processes. Problems with both visual literacy and representation of leisure contexts are developed as central motivations for producing this special issue.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0022-2216			WOS:000226151500001		J	Jung, Yoon Ja								The Necessity and Meaning of Semiological Approach to Arts			미술에 대한 기호학적 접근의 필요성과 의미					Mihak -The Korean Journal of Aesthetics	美學(미학)			37												2004	2004										0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0732			KJD:ART000952074		B	Selfe, Cynthia L.

This article is an edited transcript of that conversation. Plant and Mitchell begin by talking about points of uncertainty in their work which moved it forward. They go on to discuss the so-called 'pictorial turn', and ways in which contemporary art and film have taken on the subjects of bioengineering and the electronic revolution. Referring to images from Poussin and Dada, to a WWI recruiting poster and Jurassic Park, the conversation suggests that both technological and political developments are posing fresh challenges to the visual arts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1476-8062			WOS:000185289200007		J	Stankiewicz, MA								Between technology and literacy								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION				22	3			316	324		10.1111/1468-5949.00369					2003	2003	Art education exists between technology and literacy, that is, between the methods social groups use to equip themselves with material objects, to shape and control their environment, and the mastery of specific technologies used to communicate ideas and values. Technology and literacy also function as metaphors, implied comparisons between the visual arts and realms of contemporary education generally seen as possessing higher status in Western cultures. My intent in this historical essay is to examine both terms in historical contexts grounded in North American art education in order to reveal elements of political and social control in these metaphors. While art-making is a means to technical literacy, responding to visual images has been used as a means to maintain social groups and continue particular cultural traditions. Art education itself can be considered one of many technologies useful in managing a complex society, at the same time as it is perceived as a means of human liberation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1476-8062	1476-8070		WOS:000186033400011		J	Finan, Nicola								Visual literacy in images used for medical education and health promotion.								The Journal of audiovisual media in medicine				25	1			16	23		10.1080/0140511022011837X					2002-Mar	2002	Visual literacy and semiotic principles are widely used in the production of commercial promotional material but virtually ignored in health promotion campaigns. This paper reports a study in which three health promotion campaigns were evaluated against a nine-point framework based on semiotic principles. Using focus group methods the campaigns were further analysed for success in achieving their objectives of gaining and retaining attention, as well as delivering the intended message. On the evidence obtained, the correlation of the framework principles and effectiveness of the campaigns suggest that semiotic principles justify a higher profile in the design of health promotion material. The same may equally apply to other forms of visual presentation in the medical environment.									11	0	0	2	0	11			0140-511X			MEDLINE:12025486	12025486	J	Styles, M; Arizpe, E								A gorilla with 'Grandpa's eyes': How children interpret visual texts - A case study of Anthony Browne's 'Zoo'								CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION				32	4			261	281		10.1023/A:1012760422501					DEC 2001	2001	This article explores the multilayered nature of a single picture book by Anthony Browne and the sophisticated responses (including their own pictures) children aged 4-11 bring to interpreting such a text. Emphasis is laid on the high-level cognitive skills involved in reading visual images and links are made between seeing and thinking. Some features of the children's understanding are examined in detail; for example, how they interpret visual imagery and deal with a variety of challenging artistic features, and how their drawings show knowledge and feelings they are not yet able to articulate. The findings also suggest that some children who are not yet confident at reading print have developed impressive capacities for analysing image.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0045-6713			WOS:000172757200002		J	Oittinen, R				Johnson, Colin/H-1442-2012				On translating picture books (translating the visual)								PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY				9	2			109	125		10.1080/0907676X.2001.9961410					2001	2001	Despite their effect on the reader, illustrations are often overlooked in translation work. Morover, the problems of the visual attract little attention from scholars in the field, even though translators often have to deal with the visual, e.g., in literary, technical, and media translation. Visual literacy is also overlooked in translator training.This article deals with the visual in translation from one viewpoint: that os translating picture books. The author discusses picture books as iconotexts, unities formed by words, images, and effects. In picture books, there is interaction between two semiotic systems, one verbal and the other visual.The starting point is that translation is rewriting for different audiences in different situations. The author considers the translation of the visual within the wider frame of hermeneutics and uses semiotics in analyzing iconotexts. The article is based on two of her books: Translating for Children (2000) and the forthcoming Kuva kaantajan kadessa (Translating the Visual).									3	0	0	0	0	3			0907-676X			WOS:000172657100002		J	Noggle, G; Kaid, LL								The effects of visual images in political ads: Experimental testing of distortions and visual literacy								SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY				81	4			913	927							DEC 2000	2000	Objective. Scholars and media observers alike have bemoaned the deleterious effects of television imagery in political spot ads. In light of the increased capability of technology to distort the messages in political spots, this study tests whether or not distortions in visual imagery in televised political ads have any identifiable effect on voters. Methods. The study uses experimental tests of distorted spots and their nondistorted counterparts to determine effects of distortions. Results. Results show that the computer and video manipulations often used in spots do affect voters in predicted ways: Spots with distortions result in higher evaluations and vote likelihood for the sponsoring candidate and lower evaluations and vote likelihood for the opponent. Surprisingly, the visual literacy level of the voter did not mitigate these effects. Conclusions. These findings suggest that new technologies are making it possible for candidates to enhance their own images and to decrease those of the opponent in ways that may be damaging to the goals of informed decision making in the electoral process.

Computer science majors ore uneasy about using their eyes to examine images while art students may not have much background in the technical terminology. This column is the second in a two-part series that discusses on interdisciplinary teaching technique that overcomes these obstacles. Port one was published in Computer Graphics 34(1) February 2000 pp. 24-26. With this approach students become more familiar with the limits and possibilities of the medium of computer graphics, learn how to analyze and talk about what visual images might mean and develop a deeper understanding of time constraints. In addition, they goin confidence with technological terminology and the idea of suggesting alternative algorithms to create a desired visual "look" As a result both computer science and art students become more able to communicate effectively about and with visual imagery.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0097-8930			WOS:000088442100009		J	Trumbo, J								Visual literacy and science communication								SCIENCE COMMUNICATION				20	4			409	425		10.1177/1075547099020004004					JUN 1999	1999	Images of science are evident throughout the media, with new technologies playing an important role in allowing the creation of science representation by communication practitioners, scientists, and the public. The role of visual literacy as a key ingredient in the effective communication of science among expert and lay audiences is explored, and a framework for addressing visual literacy is suggested. Visual literacy is defined in this context as a holistic construct that includes visual thinking, visual learning, and visual communication.									37	0	0	1	0	37			1075-5470			WOS:000080638800004		S	Yamasaki, T; Hattori, T						Cumming, G; Okamoto, T; Gomez, L		An aesthetic impression extraction of the paintings for the fine arts subject								ADVANCED RESEARCH IN COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN EDUCATION, VOL 2: NEW HUMAN ABILITIES FOR THE NETWORKED SOCIETY		FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS		55				329	332							1999	1999	This paper describes an extraction method for the aesthetic impression of the paintings based on the Moon Spencer's color harmony theory for the fine arts subject. The purpose of the fine arts learning educates the ability of the sense beauty, that is, visual literacy. The impression that the human being gets from the picture depends on the motif, the color, and the composition. Here, we extract an aesthetic impression of paintings through the geometrical arrangement of the color and the analysis of the color occupation area. First, we expand a color in the Muncell color space. Next, we find a balance point, ratio of the color occupation area and the moment arm. Finally, we estimate an aesthetic measure from the number of the colors, the hue and the saturation difference. The extraction experiment is done using the typical design pictures and the famous paintings those have an excellent reputation for color handling. The aesthetic measures show high values in the work group of impressionism paintings, Manet, Monet and Klee. This method is also useful for retrieving image database using the impression word.					7th International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 99)7th International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 99)	NOV 04-07, 1999NOV 04-07, 1999	Asia-Pacific Chapter Assoc Adv Comp Educ; Univ ElectroCommun, Chiba Inst Technol; Japan Soc Educ Technol; Japan Soc Informat & Syst EducAsia-Pacific Chapter Assoc Adv Comp Educ; Univ ElectroCommun, Chiba Inst Technol; Japan Soc Educ Technol; Japan Soc Informat & Syst Educ	UNIV ELECTROCOMMUN, CHIBA INST TECHNOL, CHIBA, JAPANUNIV ELECTROCOMMUN, CHIBA INST TECHNOL, CHIBA, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0922-6389		1-58603-027-2	WOS:000084548600053		B	Brody, R; Surprenant, TT; Blake, V						Cibbarelli, PR; Nixon, C		Library web pages: A visual literacy framework for evaluation								IOLS'98: INTEGRATED ONLINE LIBRARY SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS-1998: EMBRACE AND EXTEND								21	27							1998	1998	The aspect of visual literacy that should most concern us as librarians and information professionals that information is not only contained or delivered in words and texts. There is a dynamic play between word and image on a web page and the resultant information that is presented. This paper contains an approach for practical evaluation of library web pages, based on that dynamic. Using basic visual literacy approaches and mindful of the traditional concerns for resource evaluation that are employed by librarians, it offers guidelines for evaluation.During our presentation, we examined the dynamic between words and images as it is played out in library web pages and evaluated library pages using elements of visual literacy in conjunction with more familiar content-based criteria. The authors used examples of library web pages to illustrate the approaches found in this paper and to elicit from the attendees additional strategies and approaches.

It illustrates how visual systems inform the process of listening for the meaning of foreign language words and phrases. We propose that the ability to read picture sequences as meaningful systems constitutes art important ''visual literacy'' that is essential for verbal comprehension of videos: An ability to recognize that visual images-such as what the camera focuses on, how much or how little is shown, and which people or objects are visually dominant or subordinate to others-suggest a pattern of values. Identifying values implied by these pictorial messages, we propose, helps students recognize how pictorial messages are underscored and elaborated in a video's spoken language. For this undertaking, we first briefly review key research and pedagogy in the field and then present an exercise sequence for video use that proceeds from visual to verbal systems appropriate for beginning language instruction. In conclusion, we suggest ways in which our strategies apply to a larger curricular program that integrates media in its overall learning objectives.									29	0	0	0	0	29			0026-7902			WOS:A1997XE48700003		J	Root, RL								Imagining visual literacy: The poetics and rhetoric of the image								CEA CRITIC				58	3			60	71							SPR-SUM 1996	1996										1	0	0	0	0	1			0007-8069			WOS:A1996WB28700006		J	NEWBURY, D								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION				15	1			111	113							1996	1996										0	0	0	0	0	0			0260-9991			WOS:A1996TW46500015		J	ARNHEIM, R								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								LEONARDO				29	1			77	78		10.2307/1576288					1996	1996										0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-094X			WOS:A1996TW86800018		J	PLANTINGA, C								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND, AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								FILM QUARTERLY				48	4			60	62							SUM 1995	1995										2	0	0	2	0	2			0015-1386			WOS:A1995RK33600019		J	EVANS, W								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND, AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION				45	3			189	191							SUM 1995	1995										0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9916			WOS:A1995RU18400018		J	JARVIE, IC								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND, AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								COMMUNICATION THEORY				5	1			89	&							FEB 1995	1995										0	0	0	0	0	0			1050-3293			WOS:A1995QN24600006		J	STONEHILL, B								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND, AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF SPEECH				81	1			135	136							FEB 1995	1995										0	0	0	0	0	0			0033-5630			WOS:A1995QF70900021		J	BARNHURST, KG								VISUAL LITERACY - IMAGE, MIND, AND REALITY - MESSARIS,P								JOURNALISM QUARTERLY				71	3			756	757							FAL 1994	1994										0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-3031			WOS:A1994PR49300046		J	MESSARIS, P								VISUAL MANIPULATION - VISUAL MEANS OF AFFECTING RESPONSES TO IMAGES								COMMUNICATION				13	3			181	195							1992	1992	This is a theoretical examination of ways in which visual devices can be used to affect viewers' responses to images (including advertisements, movies and TV programs, photojournalism, etc.). The discussion deals with two general topics: the composition of images and their juxtaposition. With regard to composition, it is argued that the primary instrument of visual manipulation across a broad range of mass-mediated images is the positioning of the spectator vis-a-vis the contents of the image, and that a variety of manipulative devices based on this principle derive their power from various kinds of analogies to ''real-life'' visual experience. Regarding the juxtaposition of images, it is argued that, aside from the obvious significance of context in narrative editing, the primary source of techniques of visual manipulation is the fact that visual syntax lacks explicit propositional conventions, the consequence being that visuals can be used to make implicit claims which might meet with greater resistance if put into words.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0305-4233			WOS:A1992KL61100003
